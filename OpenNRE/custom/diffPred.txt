Text: Further some of these cardiac biomarkers are validated predictors of longterm cardiovascular health or disease in children which better informs treatment decisions in highrisk groups 101 The possibility of unsuspected myocardial injury suggests that children with symptoms of COVID19 infection should also be screened for cardiac involvement by measuring serum concentrations of cardiac troponin and NTproBNP both of which have low costs in time and money and would not delay potentially more appropriate therapyWe believe the growing threat to children from COVID19 supports the following recommendations for policymakers and clinicians

Text: It is also important to highlight that differences in indications for CT imaging in children might also exist which could explain why Ma et al 23 found slightly more abnormalities on CT in children than adults but unfortunately these indications were not made clear in the publicationsChest imaging findings in children with COVID19 are frequently normal or mild with unilateral changes that include patchy groundglass opacification commonly affecting the lower lobes

Entity pair: increased/criteria
Text: The NPV of the SARINoF criteria increased by 155 for any of the viruses whereas the SARINoC criteria saw a decrease of 85 in the same categoryThe proportion of viruspositive patients meeting SARI criteria by their age yielded a clear trend with the youngest patients being less likely to meet criteria Figs 1 and 3A

Entity pair: saw/criteria
Text: The SARINoF criteria saw the greatest gains in sensitivity amongst the youngest age groups compared to the original criteria with an increase of 466 for detecting viruspositive patients Figs 46 Our study found that for ARI surveillance the SARI criteria fails to capture more than 50 of children with respiratory virus infections RVI and it performs even more poorly for children 3 months
