Text: Of course there are multiple caveatsinvestigating nasal epithelium may reveal differences that are not present in the tracheobronchial epithelium since both COVID19 symptomatic and asymptomatic patients show a greater viral yield in nasal samples than throat samples Zhou et al 2020  our RNA sequencing studies did not include donors over the age of 72 who have a higher COVID19 morbidity and mortality risk and future single cell RNA sequencing of blood or nasal epithelial brush biopsies might reveal differences in immune cell phenotype or viral response that we could not detect here
