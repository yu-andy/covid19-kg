Abstract Since the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus infection ( 2019 - nCoV ) in Wuhan City , China , by January 30 , 2020 , a total of 9692 confirmed cases and 15,238 suspected cases have been reported around 31 provinces or cities in China . Among the confirmed cases , 1527 were severe cases , 171 had recovered and been discharged at home , and 213 died . And among these cases , atotal of 28 children aged from 1 month to 17 years have been reported in China . For standardizing prevention and management of 2019 - nCoV infections in children , we called up an experts committee to formulate this experts consensus statement . This statement is based on the Novel Coronavirus Infection Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Standards ( the fourth edition ) ( National Health Committee ) and other previous diagnosis and treatment strategies for pediatric virus infections . The present consensus statement summarizes current strategies on diagnosis , treatment , and prevention of 2019 - nCoV infection in children . Background In December , 2019 , a cluster of pneumonia cases , who were later proven to be caused by a novel coronavirus ( named as 2019 - nCoV ) , emerged in Wuhan City , Hubei Province , China . By January 30,2020 , 9692 confirmed cases and 15,238 suspected cases have been reported around 31 prov - inces and cities in China . Among the confirmed cases , 1527 were severe cases , 171 had recovered and been discharged All authors contributed equally to this paper . kunlingshen1717@163.com * Kunling Shen * Yonghong Yang * Dongchi Zhao yyh628628@sina.com zhao_wh2004@hotmail.com Extended author information available on the last page of the article at home , and 213 died . Twenty - eightconfirmed cases aged from 1 month to 17 years had been reported in China [ 1 ] . Coronavirus ( CoV ) belongs to the Coronaviridae fam - ily , Nidovirales order . CoVs are divided into four genera : - , - , - , and - coronavirus . - and - coronaviruses only infect mammals , whereas - and - coronaviruses mainly infect birds , with a few infecting mammals . Human CoVs include - coronaviruses ( 229E and NL63 ) , - coronaviruses ( OC43 and HKU1 ) , the Middle East respiratory syndrome - related coronavirus ( MERS - CoV ) , severe acute respiratory syndrome - related coronavirus ( SARS - CoV ) , and 2019 - n CoV . The 2019 - nCoV belongs to the - coronavirus genus [ 2 ] , which includes bat - SARS - like ( SL ) - CoVZC45 , bat - SL - CoVZXC21 , SARS - CoV , MERS - CoV , and 2019 - nCoV . Current studies have revealed that 2019 - nCoV may originate from wild animals , but the exact origin remains unclear . 2019 - nCoV infected patients are the main infection sources . However , we also should attach importance to asymptomatic cases which may play a critical role in the Vol. : ( 0123456789 ) 1 3 World Journal of Pediatrics transmission process . Respiratory droplets and contact are the main transmission routes [ 3 ] . Close contact with symptomatic cases and asymptomatic cases with silent infection are the main transmission routes of 2019 - nCoV infection in children . People of all ages are susceptible to 2019 - nCoV . The elderly and those with underlying chronic diseases are more likely to become severe cases . Thus far , all pediatric cases with laboratory - confirmed 2019 - nCoV infection were mild cases , and no deaths hadbeen reported . For standardizing the prevention and treament of 2019 - n CoV infections in children , we called up an experts com - mittee to formulate this consensus statement . This statement is based on the Novel Coronavirus Infection Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Standards ( the fourth edition ) ( National Health Committee ) and other previous diagnosis and treatment strategies for pediatric virus infections . Auxiliary examinations Laboratory examination [ 3 ] 1 . In the early phase of the disease , white blood cell count is normal or decreased , with decreased lymphocyte count ; liver enzymes , muscle enzymes , and myohemo - globin levels are increased in some patients . 2 . Most patients display elevated C-reactive protein level and erythrocyte sedimentation rates , and normal proc- alcitonin levels . 3 . Severe cases show high D - dimer levels and progres - sively decreased blood lymphocytes counts . 4 . Samples from throat swabs ( better using nasopharyn - geal swab in children ) , sputum , lower respiratory tract secretions , stool and blood , etc. are tested positive for 2019 - nCoV nucleic acids . Clinical manifestations Chest imaging examination [ 3 ] Based on the current epidemiological data , the incubation period of 2019 - nCoV infections ranges from 1 to 14 days , mostly ranging from 3 to 7days . Current reported data of pediatric cases revealed that the age of disease onset ranged from 1.5 months to 17 years , most of whom had a close contact with infected cases or were family cluster cases [ 4 ] . Infected children might appear asymptomatic [ 5 ] or present with fever , dry cough , and fatigue , and few have upper res - piratory symptoms including nasal congestion and running nose ; some patients presented with gastrointestinal symp - toms including abdominal discomfort , nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain , and diarrhea . Most infected children have mild clinical manifestations . They have no fever or symptoms of pneumonia with a good prognosis . Most of them recover within 12 weeks after disease onset . Few may progress to lower respiratory infections . No newborns delivered by 2019 - nCoV infected mothers have been detected positive ; and no newborn cases have been reported yet . It should be noted that clinical manifestations in pediatric patients should be further defined after collecting more pediat - ric case data . Furthermore , the number of confirmed infected cases will increase after a wide use of pathogen analysis . Data from adults reveal that severe cases often develop dyspnea one week after disease onset . Severe cases may rap - idly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) , septic shock , refractory metabolic acidosis , and coagulation dysfunction [ 6 , 7 ] . Although no deaths in children have been reported up to now , the potential risk of death should be highlighted . Though clinical symptoms in pediatric patients are relatively milder compared with those in adult patients , ARDS and death cases also occurred in infected children during the SARS and MERS epidemics [ 811 ] . Suspected cases or confirmed cases should undertake chest X-ray examination as soon as possible . Chest CT scan is required when necessary . In the early stage of disease , chest images show multiple small plaques and interstitial changes , which are obvious in the lung periphery , further deteriorate to bilateral multiple ground - glass opacity and / or infiltrat - ing shadows . Lung consolidation may occur in severe cases . Pleural effusion is rarely seen . Diagnosis Suspected cases 2019 - nCoV should be suspected in patients who meet any one of the criteria in the epidemiological history and any two of the criteria in clinical manifestations . Epidemiological history 1 . Children with a travel or residence history in Wuhan city and neighboring areas , or other areas with persistent local transmission within 14 days prior to disease onset ; 2 . Children with a history of contacting patients with fever or respiratory symptoms who have a history of contact with patients from Wuhan city and neighboring areas , or other areas with persistent local transmission within 14 days prior to disease onset ; 3 . Children who are related with a cluster outbreak or close contact with 2019 - nCoV infected cases ; 4 . Newborns delivered by confirmed 2019 - nCoV - infected mothers . 1 3 World Journal of Pediatrics Clinical manifestations 1 . Fever , fatigue , dry cough ; some pediatric patients may have low - grade fever or no fever ; 2 . With above - mentioned chest imaging findings ( refer to the section of Chest imaging examination ) ; 3 . In the early phase of the disease , white blood cell count is normal or decreased , or with decreased lymphocyte count ; 4 . No other pathogens are detected which can fully explain the clinical manifestations . Confirmed cases Suspected cases who meet any one of the following criteria [ 3 ] : 1 . Respiratory tract or blood samples tested positive for 2019 - nCoV nucleic acid using RT - PCR ; 2 . Genetic sequencing of respiratory tract or blood samples is highly homologous with the known 2019 - nCoV . Clinical classifications 1 . Asymptomatic infection ( silent infection ) Children tested positive for 2019 - nCoV , but without manifestations of clinical symptoms or abnormal chest imaging findings . 2 . Acute upper respiratory tract infection Children with only fever , cough , pharyngeal pain , nasal congestion , fatigue , headache , myalgia or dis - comfort , etc. , and without signs of pneumonia by chest imaging or sepsis . 3 . Mild pneumonia Children with or without fever , respiratory symptoms such as cough ; and chest imaging indicating pneumonia , but not reaching the criteria of severe pneumonia . 4 . Severe pneumonia Meeting any of the following criteria [ 3 , 1215 ] : 5 . Critical cases Those who meet any of the following criteria and require ICU care : ( 1 ) Respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation ; ( 2 ) Shock ; ( 3 ) Combined with other organs failure . Early identification ofcritical cases According to the experiences in diagnosis and treatment of community - acquired pneumonia in children , children with a history of contact with severe 2019 - nCoV infected cases , or with underlying conditions ( such as congenital heart disease , bronchial pulmonary hypoplasia , respiratory tract anomaly , with abnormal hemoglobin level , severe malnutri - tion ) , or with immune deficiency or immunocompromised status ( under long - term use of immunosuppressants ) who meet any one of the following criteria may become severe cases : 1 . Dyspnea : respiratory rate > 50 times / min for 212 months old ; > 40 times / min for 15 years old ; > 30 times / min in patients over 5 years old ( after ruling out the effects of fever and crying ) ; 2 . Persistent high fever for 35 days ; 3 . Poor mental response , lethargy , disturbance of con - sciousness , and other changes of consciousness ; 4 . Abnormally increased enzymatic indexes , such as myo- cardial enzymes , liver enzymes , lactate dehydrogenase ; 5 . Unexplainable metabolic acidosis ; 6 . Chest imaging findings indicating bilateral or multi - lobe infiltration , pleural effusion , or rapid progression of con - ditions during a very short period ; 7 . Infants younger than 3 months ; 8 . Extrapulmonary complications ; 9 . Coinfection with other viruses and / or bacteria . ( 1 ) Increased respiratory rate : 70 times/ min ( < 1 year ) , 50 times / min ( 1 year ) ( after ruling out the effects of fever and crying ) ; ( 2 ) Oxygen saturation < 92 % ; ( 3 ) Hypoxia : assisted breathing ( moans , nasal flaring , and three concave sign ) , cyanosis , intermittent apnea ; ( 4 ) Disturbance of consciousness : somnolence , coma , ( 5 ) Food refusal or feeding difficulty , with signs of or convulsion ; dehydration . Differential diagnosis [ 3 ] Differential diagnosis should be made to distinguish from influenza virus , parainfluenza virus , adenovirus , respira - tory syncytial virus , rhinovirus , human metapneumovirus , SARS coronavirus , and other known viral infections , as well as mycoplasma pneumoniae and chlamydia pneumo - nia and bacterial pneumonia . The coinfection of 2019 - nCoV with other viruses and / or bacteria should be considered in diagnosis . 1 3 Treatment Treatment locations 1 . Based on their medical conditions , suspected patients should be isolated in a single room or self - isolated at home following the doctors advice . 2 . Confirmed cases can be admitted in the same ward . 3 . Critically cases should be admitted to ICU as soon as possible . General treatment The general treatment strategies include bed rest and sup - portive treatment ; ensuring sufficient calory and water intake ; maintaining water electrolyte balance and homeo - stasis ; monitoring vital signs and oxygen saturation ; keep - ing respiratory tract unobstructed and inhaling oxygen when necessary ; measuring blood routine , urine routine , C- reac - tive protein , and other blood biochemical indexes including liver and kidney function , myocardial enzyme spectrum , and coagulation function according to patients conditions . Blood gas analysis and timely re-examination of chest imag - ing should be performed when necessary . Symptomatic treatment The patients with high fever should be actively controlled . If patients body temperature exceeds 38.5C with obvi - ous discomfort , physical cooling ( warm water bath , use of antipyretic patch , etc. ) or antipyretic drug treatment should be performed . Common drugs include : ibuprofen orally , 510 mg/ kg every time ; acetaminophen orally , 1015 mg / kg every time . Keep children quiet and administrate sedatives immediately when convulsions or seizure occur . Oxygen therapy When hypoxia appears , effective oxygen therapy should be given immediately including nasal catheter , mask oxy - gen . Nasal high - flow oxygen therapy , and non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation should be undertaken when necessary . Antiviral therapy Interferon [ 3 , 1628 ] World Journal of Pediatrics experiences of using interferon - in treating bronchiolitis , viral pneumonia , acute upper respiratory tract infection , hand foot mouth disease , SARS , and other viral infections in children , the recommended usage is as follows : 1 . Interferon - nebulization : interferon - 200,000 400,000IU / kg or 24g / kg in 2 m L sterile water , nebu - lization two times per day for 57 days ; 2 . Interferon - 2 b spray : applied for high - risk populations with a close contact with suspected 2019 - nCoV infected patients or those in the early phase with only upper res - piratory tract symptoms . Patients should use 12 sprays on each side of the nasal cavity , 810 sprays on the oro - pharynx , the dose of interferon - 2 b per injection is 8000 IU , once every 12hours , 810 sprays / day for a course of 57 days . Lopinavir / litonavir [ 3 , 29 , 30 ] Lopinavir / litonavir has been tried to apply to the treatment of adult patients with 2019 - nCoV pneumonia , but its effi - cacy and safety remain to be determined . Usage ofother agents Antibiotics [ 3 , 12 ] Avoiding irrational use of antibiotics , especially in combina - tion with broad - spectrum antibiotics . Paying close attention to the changes of conditions in children with coinfection of bacterial or fungal infection ; actively collecting samples for pathogen analysis and timely or rational use of antibiotics or anti-fungal drugs . Arbidol [ 31 ] , oseltamivir [ 32 ] andother antiinfluenza drugs Arbidol is administrated for adults infected with 2019 - nCoV ; however , its efficacy and safety remain unclear . Oseltamivir and other anti-influenza agents can be applied for patients coinfected with other influenza virus . Other drugs [ 3 , 12 ] Glucocorticoids Interferon - can reduce viral load in the early stage of infection which can help to alleviate symptoms and shorten the course of disease . Based on our clinical research and The use of glucocorticoids should be based on the severity of systemic inflammatory response , degree of dyspnea , with or without ARDS , and the progress status of chest imag - ing results . Glucocorticoids can be used in a short period 1 3 World Journal of Pediatrics ( 35 days ) . The recommended dose of methylprednisolone should not exceed 12mg / kg / day . Immunoglobulin Immunoglobulin can be used in severe cases when indicated , but its efficacy needs further evaluation . Treatment ofsevere andcritically ill cases [ 3 , 12 ] On the basis of symptomatic treatment , we should actively prevent and treat complications , underlying diseases , sec - ondary infection , and provide organ function support as indicated . Respiratory support Children who undergo non-invasive mechanical ventilation for 2 hours without improvements in conditions , or can not tolerate non-invasive ventilation , with increased airway secretions , severe cough , or hemodynamic instability , should be subjected to invasive mechanical ventilation promptly . The invasive mechanical ventilation should adopt low tidal volume lung protective ventilation strategy to reduce ventilator related lung injury . If necessary , prone position ventilation , lung recruitment , or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO ) can be applied . Circulation support On the basis of full fluid resuscitation , improve microcircu - lation , use vasoactive drugs , and monitor hemodynamics if necessary .

Psychotherapy Suspected patients can be discharged from isolation when the detection of respiratory pathogenic nucleic acid is nega - tive for two consecutive times ( the sampling interval is at least 1day ) . Prevention [ 3335 ] Novel coronavirus infection is a new communicable dis - ease with an emergent outbreak that affects all popula - tions . 2019 - nCoV infection has been classified as category B infectious disease legally but managed as category A infectious disease . It is paramount to implement infection control practices by infection source controlling , transmis - sion route blocking , and susceptible population protection . Controlling infection sources Patients infected with 2019 - nCoV are the main infection sources . Children infected by novel coronavirus should be isolated at home or admitted to designated hospitals under the guidance of healthcare workers depending on the severity of their medical conditions . Try to provide single rooms for isolated children , and reduce the chance of con - tact with the co-residents . There are enormous demands for room ventilation , necessary cleaning , and disinfection work for the articles used by children . Equally crucial is the need of equipment with disposable masks and properly disposal after use when taking care of the sick . Psychological counseling plays an important role in disease recovery . If patients ( especially older children ) show mood swing , fear , or psychological disorders , active psychological intervention and treatment are needed . Release anddischarge criteria [ 3 ] Confirmed patients can be discharged from isolation or transferred to the corresponding departments for treatment of other diseases if all the following criteria are met : 1 . The body temperature returns to normal longer than 3 days ; 2 . The respiratory symptoms improve obviously ; Blocking transmission routes 1 . Preventing transmission by respiratory droplets and contact : Cover mouth and nose with napkin or towel when coughing or sneezing . Wash hands for children frequently , or teach children seven - step washing tech - nique . Try not to touch mouth , nose , or eyes before cleaning hands thoroughly after returning from public places , after covering the mouth when coughing , before eating or after using toilet ; regularly disinfecting toys by heating at 56C for 30 min , 75 % alcohol or chlorine - containing disinfectants , and ultraviolet rays . 2 . Reduce exposure to infection : Avoid public transport at epidemic areas , and wear masks when going to crowded or poorly ventilated public places ; avoid touching or eat - 1 3 World Journal of Pediatrics ing wild animals , and going to markets selling with live animals . 3 . Childrens health monitoring : Children with a history of close contacts of infected patients need to be monitored for body temperature and clinical features routinely . When presenting with suspicious symptoms , children should be taken to a designated hospital for screening . Newborns delivered by infected mothers must complete a pathogen test and be isolated in a single ward or at home according to their medical conditions . Boosting immunity Balanced diet , oral health , adequate exercise , regular rest , avoiding excessive fatigue , and boosting immunity are the powerful measures to preventing infection , as well as main - taining emotional stability and mental health . Vaccination is an effective way to prevent virus infection . The research and development of anti-virus vaccines has been carried out in China at present .
