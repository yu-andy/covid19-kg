of pneumonia caused by the SARSCoV2 Severe acute respiratory syn drome coronavirus 2 has been declared as a global public health concern by WHO As of April 3 2020 more than 1000000 human infections have been diagnosed around the world which exhibited apparent persontoperson transmission characteristics of this virus The capacity of vertical transmission in SARSCoV2 remains controversial recently Angio tensinconverting enzyme 2 ACE2 is now confirmed as the receptor of SARSCoV2 and plays essential roles in human infection and transmission In present study we collected the online available singlecell RNA sequencing scRNAseq data to evaluate the cell specific expression of ACE2 in maternalfetal interface as well as in multiple fetal organs Our results revealed that ACE2 was highly expressed in maternalfetal interface cells including stromal cells and perivascular cells of decidua and cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast in pla centa Meanwhile ACE2 was also expressed in specific cell types of human fetal heart liver and lung but not in kidney And in a study containing series fetal and postnatal mouse lung we observed ACE2 was dynamically changed over the time and ACE2 was extremely high in neonatal mice at postnatal day 13 In summary this study revealed that the SARS CoV2 receptor was widely spread in specific cell types of maternalfetal interface and fetal organs And thus both the vertical transmission and the placenta dysfunctionabortion caused by SARSCo V2 need to be further carefully investigated in clinical practice Introduction The new type of pneumonia caused by the SARSCoV2 has sparked alarm around the world 1 The ongoing outbreak was first reported in Wuhan China in December 2019 and as of April 3 2020 more than 1000000 human infections

79 sequence identify to SARSCoV Severe acute respira tory syndrome coronavirus and they may both share the ACE2 as host receptor according to structural analyses4 SARSCoV uses ACE2 as one of the main receptors for the entry into the host cells which plays a crucial role in the disease infection 5 The target towards the inter action between the virus and receptor may be able to treat the disease ACE2 is newly described as Reninangiotensin system RAS component and modulates blood pressure6 The expres sion and distribution of ACE2 has been reported in heart lungs and kidneys which exhibits tissuespecific activity patterns 79 Previous studies have also shown the expression of ACE2 in the placenta10 Furthermore the serine protease for virus Spike S protein priming TMPRSS2 was identified to be indispensable for cell entry of SARSCoV2 11 The placenta is a unique mixed organ acting as heart lungs liver kidneys for the fetus which is formed only during pregnancy and plays a major role in preventing maternalfetal transmission of pathogens 12 It has been reported that members of the coronavirus family such as SARSCoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome MERSCoV may pose greater risk in pregnant women than nonpregnant individuals and are responsible for severe complica tions during pregnancy 13 14 Considering the new SARSCoV2 seems to share similar pathogenic and cell receptor as SARSCoV the new coronavirus may have the vertical trans mission potential to the fetus in pregnant women with SARSCoV2 15 Given the current lack of clinical data of the potential and outcome of pregnancy infected by the SARSCo V2 we use the promising scRNAseq data to evaluate the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in maternalfetal interface and different fetal organs Our study gives a better perspective of vertical transmission potential and viruss impact on placenta function and early pregnancy on the cellular level Method Public dataset acquisition and processing Human placenta Gene

pbmc3ktutorialhtml Since the low quality cells had been excluded by original authors we did nt conduct the quality control procedures Results Cell specific expression of ACE2 TMPRSS2 in maternalfetal interface Placenta and decidua are the main maternalfetal interface during pregnancy and virus recep tors expression in placenta and decidual cells may play important role in promoting transmis sion of SARSCoV2 We obtained single cell transcriptome data sequenced by 10X Genomics of early placenta 614 gestational weeks containing 65000 cell s 16 And 32 cell types were observed of which four main cell types expressed ACE2 gene including stromal cells d S and perivascular cells d P in decidua and villous cytotrophoblast VCT and syncytiotrophoblast SCT in placenta Fig 1A and 1B The extravillous trophoblast EVT did not express ACE2 at this time TMPRSS2 was expressed in VCT and epithelial glandular cells Epi and also had low expression in SCT Another independent single cell study of trophoblasts in human pla centa confirmed the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in VCT and SCT Fig 1C17 In addition the EVT cells had extremely low level of ACE2 at early placenta 8 week which was consistent with previous study while the ACE2 expression was significantly increased in EVT at later stage of pregnancy 24 week And TMPRSS2 also found a similar dynamic alteration Fig 1C These results suggest that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were coexpressed in VCT SCT and EVT cells in maternalfetal interface and the expression level of ACE2 TMPRSS2 in maternal fetal interface may increase along with trimester of pregnancy Cell specific expression of ACE2 TMPRSS2 in human fetal organs As the essential elements of virus transmission the expression of virus receptors in target organs is another determining factor for fetus vulnerable to SARSCoV2 We then screened the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in multiple fetal organs including heart lungs liver and kidneys based on the online published single cell transcriptome studies In a fetal heart single cell study covering early to late fetal stages 18 we observed that ACE2 was expressed in cardi omyocytes CM macrophages and smooth muscle cells and pericytes SMC Peri TMPRSS2 was also observed in cardiomyocytes In a human fetal liver cell atlas 19 ACE2 was detected in erythroid fibroblast and hepatocyte Fig 2B Although it seems that there was no change of ACE2 over the gestational stage Fig 2C the expression proportion of ACE2 was gradually increased in fibroblast and hepatocytes from early to midstage of pregnancy Fig 2D And hepatocytes possessed the highest proportion of ACE2 positive cells compared to fibroblast and erythroid Fig 2D The expression of TMPRSS2 was relatively lower but could be found in hepatocyte and kuppffer cells Fig 2B In a single cell study of fetal kidney at 79 week we did not observe ACE2 expression in any cell type and the abundance of TMPRSS2 was extremely low and there were only few positive cells in ILC precursor and megakar yocyte sub types Fig 2E In a lung cell atlas of human at postnatal day 1 we observed that both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were highly expressed in airway epithelial cell and arterial endothelial cells AT1 and AT2 Fig 2F As lung is the major target organ of SARSCoV2 the high co expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 strongly suggests a high risk of infection of newborns

abundant expression of ACE2 and moderate expression of TMPRSS2 in the main human fetal organs Dynamic expression of ACE2 TMPRSS2 in fetal and neonatal mouse lung Since the respiratory system undergoes a series of structural and functional changes necessary for adaptation to air breathing at birth and lung is a major organ to be attacked by SARS CoV2 virus the dynamic changes of pulmonary cells gene expression are necessary to be investigated before and after birth to predict the potential infection of fetal and neonatal indi viduals Because cell atlas of human fetal lung is unavailable we obtained mouse lung cell atlas from late pregnancy E165 E185 to PND 28 The cell type annotation obtained from previ ous report was shown in Fig 3A21 In late pregnancy stage both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were highly expressed in airway epithelial cells which were consistent with human fetal lung A sig nificant alteration of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was observed in murine lung At earliest days PND 13 we observed ACE2 TMPRSS2 was highly coexpressed in many cell types such as Sox2 hi alveolar cells AT1 AT2 ciliated cell and Club cells Pulmonary cells at this stage exhibited higher expression of ACE2 than that in fetal phase or later days suggesting that new born might be a highrisk population vulnerable to be infected by SARSCo V2 After the PND 13 ACE2 and TMPRSS2 recovered to relatively low level in lung and mainly expressed in epithelial cells which is similar to that in adult human lung 22 Fig 3B and 3C These results suggest that the alternative expression of ACE2 TMPRSS2 in pulmonary cells before and after birth may contribute to the virus infection through vertical or respiratory transmis sion and ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were highly coexpressed across different cell types of murine lung And the molecular cell study of human lung at fetal and postnatal stage is further neces sary to reveal the potency and mechanism of infant infection by SARSCoV2 Discussion As the SARSCoV2 pandemic continues pregnant women may be at high risks of affection due to under an immunosuppressive state and the affection status of mothers may cause adverse maternal and neonatal complications and outcomes 15 Following this the urgent questions need to be addressed are that whether the SARSCoV2 could be transmitted verti cally to the fetus through maternalfetal interface and whether the affection of the virus would cause the dysfunction of placenta or even abortion among pregnant women Based on the scRNAseq data of early human placenta first trimester we have identified the high expression of ACE2 in four main cell types including d S cells and d P cells in decidua VCT and SCT cells in placenta However the expression of ACE2 was at extremely low level in EVT at first trimester The second study of human placenta confirmed the result and showed increasing expression of ACE2 in EVT at 24 week The major function of the placenta is main tained by trophoblast cells including VCT SCT and EVT23 The SCT is the outer lining of the placental villi which has direct contact with maternal blood flowing into the intervillous space which also plays as the main site of maternal and fetal exchange 24 The high expression of ACE2 in these cells suggests that placenta has the potential to be infected by SARSCo V2 and may cause placenta dysfunction and pregnancy complications Yet there is no scRNAseq data human placenta in third trimester we predict the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in maternalfetal interface may increase along with trimester of pregnancy Importantly it has PLOS ONE

decidua and SCT cells in placenta using immunohistochemistry IHC which was in accor dance with the m RNA expression pattern from our finding s 10 25 We then assessed the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the main organs including fetal heart lung liver and kidney The expression of ACE2 was detected in the main cell types of heart like CM and SMCPeri and TMPRSS2 was also observed in CM CM is the major func tional cells of heart and may cause cardiac dysfunction if affected by viru s 26 SMC Peri cells are major perivascular cell types 27 and may be involved in the implantation of virus through infiltration of blood vessels The increasing expression of ACE2 in liver fibroblast and hepatocytes was detected from first to second trimester These results suggest that fetal liver is an vulnerable target organ of SARSCOV 2 virus and it s risk is increasing as the pregnancy progresses Interestingly we did not detect the ACE2 expression in kidney while TMPRSS2 was moderately expressed in this organ This result is different from adult human kidney in which ACE2 is highly expressed in proximal convoluted tubule cells and proximal tubule cells 28 We further analyzed the data of human lung at PND 1 both airway epithelial cell and arte rial endothelial cells showed high expression of ACE2 This result is different from adult lung in which alveolar cells AT1 AT2 were the major ACE2 cell types 22 As the fetus has no breath in maternal uterus the airway epithelial cell may not be responsible for the vertical transmission of virus but may play essential role in neonatal infection via respiratory trans mission Alternatively the arterial endothelial cell expression of ACE2 may contribute to the potential intrauterine infection of fetal lung The data of a study containing series fetal and postnatal mouse lung was analyzed and we observed ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were extremely high in neonatal mice at PND 13 The high level of ACE2 in lung may make neonate vulnera ble target of SARSCoV2 Humans and mouse are highly conservative regarding gene expres sion pattern and we speculate that ACE2 may have the similar dynamic alterations of gene expression in human lungs from fetal to neonatal phase which needs to be further investigated to evaluate the risk of intrauterine infection canal infection and transmission possibility through postnatal respiratory systems Given the genomic similarity between SARSCoV2 and SARSCoV many clinical studies have done on pregnant women affected by SARSCoV To our knowledge no published arti cles have reported the existence of maternalfetal transmission of SARSCoV in clinical cases 29 Considering the low spread ability of SARSCoV with 8000 infected patients worldwide the population of infected pregnant women was minimal among them and thus the potency of vertical transmission was evaluated insufficiently in SARS However the SARSCoV2 has become superspreading event around the world and been announced as a pandemic by WHO which caused more than 1000000 cases worldwide as of April 3 2020 Much more cases of pregnant women infected by SARSCo V2 have been observed compared to SARS CoV Chen et al has recently reported the result of pregnancy of nine pregnant women who had pneumonia caused by SARSCo V230 Four infants were born prematurely but none were born earlier than 36 weeks of gestation All the infants and samples including amniotic fluid cord blood neonatal throat swabs showed negative result of the virus However given the small sample size the short time between illness onset and delivery and the biased included pregnant women who were all at the latestage of pregnancy and gave birth by cesarean sec tion vertical transmission of SARSCo V2 still can not be ruled out in this study Most recently Dong et al has reported a newborn with elevated IgM antibodies to SARSCoV2 As IgM can not be transferred across the placenta and can only be produced by the fetus in response to virus this result suggests that the neonate was infected in utero And the liver injury of this neonate from the laboratory results also indirectly supports the possibility of ver tical transmission31 Another report collected the data of 6 pregnant women with PLOS ONE httpsdoiorg101371journalpone0230295 April 16 2020 8 12 PLOS ONE ACE2 expression in maternalfetal interface SARSCoV2 Notably the virusspecific antibodies were detected in neonatal blood sera sam ples and the IgG concentrations which could be passively transferred across the placenta from mother to fetus elevated in 5 infants Importantly 2 infants were also detected the existence of IgM32 33 These clinical studies strongly support the potency of vertical transmission of SARSCo V2 which is highly consistent with our hypothesis based on the cell specific enriched expression of the virus receptors in maternalinternal face and fetal organs Furthermore women infected by SARSCoV during pregnancy had a higher incidence of adverse outcomes including spontaneous miscarriage premature delivery and intrauterine growth restriction 13 High maternal morbidity and mortality was associated with SARSCoV during pregnancy 34 The placental pathophysiology changes may be correlated with clinical courses of the mother and fetus 35 But the number of reported cases of pregnant women with SARSCoV is very limited Nevertheless pregnant women with SARSCoV2 had mild symptoms and better outcome compared with those with SARSCo V30 The biophysical and structural evidence showed that SARSCoV2 bind ACE2 with higher affinity than SARSCoV which suggested that SARSCoV2 might have more possibility to attack placenta36 The published cases so far are quite limited and are restricted to women developing SARSCoV2 infection in third trimester late pregnancy stage It is still crucial to pay special attention to pregnant women infected with SARSCoV2 in early stage during which the virus may affect the function of placenta and increase the risk of miscarriage Study limitations There are several limitations to this study First the gene expression levels were detected at m RNA levels Although several previous studies confirmed the protein expression of ACE2 in placenta by IHC systematic experimental validation of the protein distributions in maternal fetal interface and fetal organs is necessary in the future The second this study reported the distribution of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 but the existence of vertical transmission and placenta dysfunction caused by SARSCoV2 infection is just speculative which needs to be further evaluated by clinical investigations The third we revealed the dramatic alterations of ACE2 TMPRSS2 expression from fetal to neonatal phases in mouse lung which may contribute to the respiratory transmission in neonates But the alterative gene expression pattern in human lung is not available to date which needs to be further illuminated in the future Conclusion This study demonstrates the expression of SARSCoV2 receptors in human maternalfetal interface and the main fetal organs Both the vertical transmission and the placenta dysfunc tionabortion caused by SARSCo V2 need to be further carefully investigated in clinical practice Acknowledgments We thank all the authors who provided the onlineavailable single cell sequencing data Conceptualization Mengmeng Li Liang Chen Jingxiao Zhang
