profound effect on every aspect of our lives Most who read this will do so from their own homes It will have been weeks since many of us were at our normal place of work and it is likely to be many weeks probably months before we are back there Videoconferencing is becoming second nature for us all Research into COVID19 is exploding as it needs to and this includes randomised trials Between 23 January 2020 and 8 March 2020 there were 382 new registered COVID19 trials on the World Health Organisation International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ICTRP 1 The ICTRP COVID19 trial list had grown to 586 by 31 March 2020 2 Most are based in China but the COVID19 pandemic is now global and trials are mov ing with it Governments and the public are clamouring for safe and effective treatments Without rigorous pro randomised trials we risk exposing many spective people to treatments that might not work Now more than ever we need trialists to predefine and publicly post their designs and analyses For transparency for clear reporting and to avoid du plication of effort researchers need to know details about these trials and they need to know quickly Trials is proud of its record of publishing trial protocols but the process can be timeconsuming in normal times and these are far from normal times Trials wants for COVID19 trials that have ethical approval much faster to make publishing protocols Correspondence streweekmaccom 1 University of Aberdeen Aberdeen UK Full list of author information is available at the end of the article and much simpler Starting immediately Trials is imple menting a simplified process for handling COVID19 trial protocols We understand that funding may be lim ited or difficult to secure at this time BMC the pub lisher of Trials has a robust commitment to ensuring that all work is published without barriers for authors who may lack funding especially important during the COVID19 outbreak If you anticipate difficulty in speedily covering the cost of articleprocessing charges please state this in your initial inquiry and request a fee waiver The process is outlined in Table 1 This process ensures rapid publication of a onepage structured summary based on Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials for abstracts 4 which will be indexed by PubMed The full protocol will be attached as an additional file and assigned a separate DOI digital object identifier via Figshare 5 In the interest of ex pediting dissemination of this material the familiar Tri als formatting and structure will not be necessary for this additional file This will make full protocols quickly available to other trialists and to trial funders Registry entries could also link back to the structured summary The changes current pandemic everything For COVID19 trial protocols transparency and speed must take precedence Our editorial processes have been streamlined and authors will receive direct support from us to ready their structured summary for publication We do however urge trialists to ensure that their studies are well designed and well reported Good design and reporting are needed no less in times of pandemics We also encourage authors to submit their full protocol in the normal way for review to ensure reporting The Authors 2020 Open Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 40
