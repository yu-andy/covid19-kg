coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 causing severe acute respiratory syndrome expanded globally from Wuhan China In March 2020 the World Health Organization declared the SARSCov 2 virus a global pandemic We performed a narrative review to describe existing literature with regard to Corona Virus Disease 2019 COVID19 epidemiology pathophysiology diagnosis management and future perspective MEDLINE EMBASE and Scopus databases were searched for relevant articles Although only when the pandemic ends it will be possible to assess the full health social and economic impact of this global disaster this review represents a picture of the current state of the art In particular we focus on public health impact pathophysiology and clinical manifestations diagnosis case management emergency response and preparedness Keywords coronavirus COVID19 pathogenesis preparedness emergency pandemic 1 Introduction At the end of 2019 a series of pneumonia cases of unknown cause emerged in Wuhan Hubei China 1 A few weeks later in January 2020 deep sequencing analysis from lower respiratory tract samples identied a novel virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 as causative agent for that observed pneumonia cluster 2 On February 11th 2020 the World Health Organization WHO DirectorGeneral Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus named the disease caused by the SARSCoV2 as COVID19 and by March 11th 2020 when the number of countries involved was 114 with more than 118000 cases and over 4000 deaths the WHO declared the pandemic status 3 Corona Virus Disease 2019 COVID19 is an RNA virus with a typical crownlike appearance under an electron microscope due to the presence of glycoprotein spikes on its envelope 4 It is not the rst time that a coronavirus causing an epidemic has been a signicant global health threat in November 2019 an outbreak of coronaviruses CoVs with severe acute respiratory syndrome SARSCoV started in the Chinese province of Guangdong and again in September 2012 the Middle East respiratory syndrome MERSCo V appeared 5 There are four genera of CoVs I coronavirus alph aCoV II coronavirus bet aCoV probably present in bats and rodents while III coronavirus delt aCoV and IV coronavirus gamm a CoV probably represent avian species 46 The virus has Int J Environ Res Public Health 2020 17 2690 doi103390ijerph17082690 wwwmdpicomjournalijerph International

origin two scenarios that can plausibly explain the origin of SARSCo V2 are i natural selection in an animal host before zoonotic transfer and ii natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer 56 Clinical features and risk factors are highly variable making the clinical severity range from asymptomatic to fatal 7 Understanding of COVID19 is ongoing This review aims to summarize early ndings on the epidemiology clinical features diagnosis management and prevention of COVID19 11 Epidemiology The COVID19 epidemic expanded in early December from Wuhan Chinas 7th most populous city throughout China and was then exported to a growing number of countries The rst conrmed case of COVID19 outside China was diagnosed on 13th January 2020 in Bangkok Thailand 8 On the 2nd of March 2020 67 territories outside mainland China had reported 8565 conrmed cases of COVID19 with 132 deaths as well as signicant community transmission occurring in several countries worldwide including Iran and Italy and it was declared a global pandemic by the WHO on the 11th of March 2020 9 The number of conrmed cases is constantly increasing worldwide and after Asian and European regions a steep increase in cases is currently 31 March 2020 being observed in lowincome countries 10 It is problematic to quantify the exact size of this pandemia as it would necessary to count all cases including not only severe and symptomatic cases but also mild ones 11 Unfortunately to date there is not a global and standard response to the pandemia and each country is facing the crisis based on their own possibilities expertise and hypotheses Thus there are dierent criteria for testing hospitalisation and estimating of cases making it dicult to calculate the number of people aected by epidemic Based on the data we have so far the estimated case fatality ratio among medically attended patients is approximately 2 but also in this case a true ratio may not be known for some time 12 Today 31st of March 2020 based on the WHO reports we have globally 693224 conrmed cases and 33106 deaths distributed as follows Western Pacic Region 103775 cases and 3649 deaths European Region 392757 cases and 29962 deaths South East Asia Region 4084 cases and 158 deaths Eastern Mediterranean Region 46329 cases and 2813 deaths Region of the Americas 142081 cases and 2457 deaths and in the Africa region 3486 cases and 60 deaths 13 12 Pathophysiology and Clinical Manifestation cid48 cid48 cap structure and 3 To address the pathogenetic mechanisms of SARSCoV2 its viral structure and genome must be considered Coronaviruses are enveloped positive strand RNA viruses with the largest known RNA genomes3032 kbwith a 5 poly A tail Starting from the viral RNA the synthesis of polyprotein 1 a 1 ab pp1 app1 ab in the host is realized 14 The transcription works through the replicationtranscription complex RCT organized in doublemembrane vesicles and via the synthesis of subgenomic RNAs sgRNAs sequences Of note transcription termination occurs at transcription regulatory sequences located between the socalled open reading frames ORFs that work as templates for the production of subgenomic m RNAs 15 In the atypical CoV genome at least six ORFs can be present Among these a frameshift between ORF1 a and ORF1 b guides the production of both pp1 a and pp1 ab polypeptides that are processed by virally encoded chymotrypsinlike protease 3 CLpro or main protease Mpro as well as one or two papainlike proteases for producing 16 nonstructural proteins nsps 15 Apart from ORF1a and ORF1b other ORFs encode for structural proteins including spike membrane envelope and nucleocapsid proteins and accessory proteic chains 1415 Dierent CoVs present special structural and accessory proteins translated by dedicated sg RNAs Pathophysiology and virulence mechanisms of CoVs and therefore also of SARSCo V2 have links to the function of the nsps and structural proteins For instance research has underlined that nsps are able to block the host innate immune response 16 Among the functions of the structural proteins the envelope has a crucial role in virus pathogenicity as it promotes viral assembly and release Int J Environ Res Public Health 2020 17 2690 3 of 11 The pathogenic mechanism that produces pneumonia seems to be particularly complex 1416 The data so far available seem to indicate that the viral infection is capable of producing an excessive immune reaction in the host In some cases a reaction takes place which as a whole is labelled a cytokine storm The eect is extensive tissue damage The protagonist of this storm is interleukin 6 IL6 IL6 is produced by activated leukocytes and acts on a large number of cells and tissues 17 It is able to promote the dierentiation of B lymphocytes promotes the growth of some categories of cells and inhibits the growth of others It also stimulates the production of acute phase proteins and plays an important role in thermoregulation in bone maintenance and in the functionality of the central nervous system 18 Although the main role played by IL6 is proinammatory it can also have antiinammatory eects In turn IL6 increases during inammatory diseases infections autoimmune disorders cardiovascular diseases and some types of cancer 19 It is also implicated into the pathogenesis of the cytokine release syndrome CRS that is an acute systemic inammatory syndrome characterized by fever and multiple organ dysfunction 20 The virus might pass through the mucous membranes especially nasal and larynx mucosa then enters the lungs through the respiratory tract Then the virus would attack the targeting organs that express angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ACE2 such as the lungs heart renal system and gastrointestinal tract 1820 The virus begins a second attack causing the patients condition to aggravate around 7 to 14 days after onset B lymphocyte reduction may occur early in the disease which may aect antibody production in the patient Besides the inammatory factors associated with diseases mainly containing IL6 were signicantly increased which also contributed to the aggravation of the disease around 2 to 10 days after onset The clinical spectrum of COVID19 varies from asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic forms to clinical conditions characterized by severe respiratory failure that necessitates mechanical ventilation and support in an intensive care unit ICU to multiorgan and systemic manifestations in terms of sepsis septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndromes MODS 21 Asymptomatic infections have also been described but their frequency is unknown The main symptoms are reported in Table 1 Pneumonia appears to be the most frequent serious manifestation of infection characterized primarily by fever cough dyspnea and bilateral inltrates on chest imaging 22 There are no specic clinical features that can yet reliably distinguish COVID19 from other viral respiratory infections Other less common symptoms have included headaches sore throat and rhinorrhea In addition to respiratory symptoms gastrointestinal symptoms eg nausea and diarrhea have also been reported and in some patients they may be the presenting complaint Respiratory droplet transmission is the main route and it can also be transmitted through persontoperson contacts by asymptomatic carriers 2122 Table 1 Main COVID19associated symptoms Fever Cough Dyspnea Headach Sore throat Rhinorrhea Chest CT in patients with COVID19 most commonly demonstrates groundglass opacication with or without consolidative abnormalities consistent with viral pneumonia 23 Chest CT abnormalities are more likely to be bilateral have a peripheral distribution and involve the lower lobes Less common ndings include pleural thickening pleural eusion and lymphadenopathy 24 Chest CT may be helpful in making the diagnosis but no nding can completely rule in or rule out the possibility of COVID19 The possibility of COVID19 should be considered primarily in patients with new onset fever andor respiratory tract symptoms eg cough dyspnea 2325 It should also be considered in patients with severe lower respiratory tract illness without any clear cause Although these syndromes can occur with other viral respiratory illnesses the likelihood of COVID19 is increased if Int J Environ Res Public Health 2020 17 2690 4 of 11 the patient 26 1 resides in or has travelled within the prior 14 days to a location where there is community transmission of SARSCoV2 ie large numbers of cases that can not be linked to specic transmission chains 2 has had close contact with a conrmed or suspected case of COVID19 in the prior 14 days including through work in health care settings Close contact includes being within approximately six feet about two meters of a patient for a prolonged period of time while not wearing personal protective equipment or having direct contact with infectious secretions while not wearing personal protective equipment The period from the onset of COVID19 symptoms to death ranges from 6 to 41 days with a median of 14 days 27 This period is dependent on the age of the patient and status of the patients immune system It was shorter among patients 70 years old compared with those under the age of 70 years The most common symptoms at onset of COVID19 illness are fever cough and fatigue while other symptoms include sputum production headache haemoptysis diarrhoea dyspnoea and lymphopenia 26 The WHO has reported an incubation period for COVID19 between 2 and 10 days However some literature suggests that the incubation period can last longer than two weeks and it is possible that a very long incubation period could reect double exposure 26 Many studies support a 14 day medical observation period for people exposed to the pathogen The severity of the clinical picture seems to be correlated with age 70 years comorbidities such as diabetes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD hypertension obesity and male sex but currently no scientically valid explanations have been developed 2729 2 Diagnosis For patients with suspected infection the following diagnosis techniques are utilised performing realtime uorescence RTPCR to detect the positive nucleic acid of SARSCoV2 in sputum throat swabs and secretions of the lower respiratory tract samples 30 In patients with COVID19 the white blood cell count can vary Leukopenia leukocytosis and lymphopenia have been reported although lymphopenia appears most common 3031 Elevated lactate dehydrogenase and ferritin levels are common and elevated aminotransferase levels have also been described On admission many patients with pneumonia have normal serum procalcitonin levels however in those requiring ICU care they are more likely to be elevated High Ddimer levels and more severe lymphopenia have been associated with mortality Imaging ndings Chest computed tomography CT in patients with COVID19 most commonly demonstrates groundglass opacication with or without consolidative abnormalities consistent with viral pneumonia Others study have suggested that chest CT abnormalities are more likely to be bilateral have a peripheral distribution and involve the lower lobes Less common ndings include pleural thickening pleural eusion and lymphadenopathy 2325 Chest CT may be helpful in making the diagnosis but no nding can completely rule in or rule out the possibility of COVID19 An oropharyngeal swab can be collected but is not essential if collected it should be placed in the same container as the nasopharyngeal specimen An oropharyngeal swab is an acceptable alternative if nasopharyngeal swabs are unavailable 32 Expectorated sputum should be collected from patients with productive cough induction of sputum is not recommended A lower respiratory tract aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage should be collected from patients who are intubated Data from this study suggested that viral RNA levels are higher and more frequently detected in nasal compared with oral specimens although only eight nasal swabs were tested SARSCoV2 RNA is detected by reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction RTPCR 33 A positive test for SARSCoV2 generally conrms the diagnosis of COVID19 although falsepositive tests are possible If initial testing is negative but the suspicion for COVID19 remains the WHO recommends resampling and testing from multiple respiratory tract sites 34 The accuracy and predictive values of SARSCoV2 testing have not been systematically evaluated Negative RTPCR tests on oropharyngeal swabs despite CT ndings suggestive of viral pneumonia have been reported in some patients who ultimately tested positive for SARSCoV2 Serologic tests once generally available should be able to identify Int J Environ Res Public Health 2020 17 2690 5 of 11 patients who have either current or previous infection but a negative PCR test 3536 Coinfection with SARSCoV2 and other respiratory viruses including inuenza has been reported and this may impact management decisions 3 Management There is no specic antiviral treatment recommended for COVID19 and no vaccine is currently available 37 The treatment is symptomatic and oxygen therapy represents the major treatment intervention for patients with severe infection Mechanical ventilation may be necessary in cases of respiratory failure refractory to oxygen therapy whereas hemodynamic support is essential for managing septic shock 37 Dierent strategies can be used depending on the severity of the patient and local epidemiology 3839 Home management is appropriate for asymptomatic or paucisintomatic patients They need a daily assessment of body temperature blood pressure oxygen saturation and respiratory symptoms for about 14 days Management of such patients should focus on prevention of transmission to others and monitoring for clinical status with prompt hospitalization if needed Outpatients with COVID19 should stay at home and try to separate themselves from other people in the household They should wear a face mask when in the same room or vehicle as other people and when presenting to health care settings Disinfection of frequently touched surfaces is also important The optimal duration of home isolation is uncertain but in consideration of incubation time around 14 days without symptoms fever dyspnoea others are considered sucient to end home isolation Some patients with suspected or documented COVID19 have severe disease that warrants hospital care Management of such patients consists of ensuring appropriate infection control and supportive care Patients with severe disease often need oxygenation support Highow oxygen and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation have been used Some patients may develop acute respiratory distress syndrome and warrant intubation with mechanical ventilation extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may be indicated in patients with refractory hypoxia The main pharmacological experimental options are summarised in Table 2 Glucocorticoids should not be used in patients with COVID19 pneumonia unless there are other indications eg exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 4041 Glucocorticoids have been associated with an increased risk for mortality in patients with inuenza and delayed viral clearance in patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus MERSCoV infection Although they were widely used in management of severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS there was no good evidence for benet and there was persuasive evidence of adverse short and longterm harm 4243 Table 2 Main Corona Virus Disease 2019 COVID19 pharmacological experimental options Glucocorticoids Remdesivir Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine Tocilizumab Lopinavirritonavir Baraticinib Nonsteroidal antiinammatory drugs Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 mainly in combination with azithromycin A number of investigational agents are being explored for antiviral treatment of COVID19 and enrolment in clinical trials should be discussed with patients or their proxies Certain investigational agents have been described in observational studies or are being used anecdotally based on in vitro or extrapolated evidence It is important to emphasize that there are no controlled data supporting the use of any of these agents and their ecacy for COVID19 is unknown Remdesivir is a novel nucleotide analogue that has activity against SARSCoV2 in vitro and related coronaviruses including SARS and MERSCoV both in vitro and in animal studies The compassionate Int J Environ Res Public Health 2020 17 2690 6 of 11 use of remdesivir through an investigational new drug application has been described in various studies 4445 Any clinical impact of remdesivir on COVID19 remains unknown Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have antiviral activity in vitro as well as antiinammatory activities They act on interference with the cellular receptor ACE2 on impairment of acidication of endosomes and on activity against many proinammatory cytokines eg IL1 and IL6 4647 Other experiments have shown that azithromycin in combination with hydroxychloroquine appeared to have additional benet but there are methodologic concerns about the control groups for the study and the biologic basis for using azithromycin in this setting is unclear 48 Despite the limited clinical data given the relative safety of shortterm use of hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin the lack of known eective interventions and the in vitro antiviral activity some clinicians think it is reasonable to use one or both of these agents in hospitalized patients with severe or risk for severe infection particularly if they are not eligible for other clinical trials The possibility of drug toxicity including QT interval QTc prolongation and retinal toxicity should be considered prior to using hydroxychloroquine particularly in individuals who may be more susceptible to these eects including epilepsy porphyria myasthenia gravis and retinal pathologyglucose6 phosphate dehydrogenase G6 PD deciency 4749 Tocilizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody which binds to the interleukin6 IL6 receptor and blocks it from functioning It is used for patients with severe COVID19 and elevated IL6 levels the agent is being evaluated in a clinical trial 50 Lopinavirritonavir appears to have little to no role in the treatment of SARSCoV2 infection 51 This combined protease inhibitor which has primarily been used for HIV infection has in vitro activity against the SARSCoV 36 and appears to have some activity against MERSCoV in animal studies 52 However there was no dierence in time to clinical improvement or mortality at 28 days in a randomized trial of 199 patients with severe COVID19 given lopinavirritonavir 400100 mg twice daily for 14 days in addition to standard care versus those who received standard of care alone 53 Moreover limited evidence are available for baraticinib a numbassociated kinase NAK inhibitor with a particularly high anity for the kinase AAK1 a pivotal regulator of clathrinmediated endocytosis anakinra an anti IL1 used in some UTI settings in Lombardy Italy and faviparavir a RNAdependent RNApolymerase inhibitor Support oxygen therapy with highow nasal oxygen HFNO should be used only in selected patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure Compared with standard oxygen therapy HFNO reduces the need for intubation Patients with hypercapnia hemodynamic instability multiorgan failure or abnormal mental status should generally not receive HFNO although emerging data suggest that HFNO may be safe in patients with mildmoderate and nonworsening hypercapnia Noninvasive ventilation NIV patients treated with either HFNO or NIV should be closely monitored for clinical deterioration Mechanical ventilation is the main supportive treatment for critically ill patients 5455 In positive patients with a DDimer value four times higher than the normal limit and without anticoagulant contraindications an anticoagulation therapy is recommended 56 The French Medicines Agency on its ocial page warns of the possible harmful eects of nonsteroidal antiinammatory drugs NSAIDs The European Medicines Agency EMA for its part undertakes to carry out an investigation in this regard and collect data but is not reluctant to advise against its use however it is advisable to prudently take paracetamol in the rst instance 57 Interestingly there is hypothesis of the link between angiotensin converting enzyme ACE inhibitors and COVID19 Indeed SARSCoV2 uses ACE receptor 2 for entry into target and in animal experiments both lisinopril and losartan can signicantly increase m RNA expression of cardiac ACE2 If this were the case we might be able to reduce the risk of fatal COVID19 courses in many patients by temporarily replacing these drugs 58 Existing literature strongly recommends that healthy patients continue therapy and in hospitalized patients to modify ACEIARB with other therapy calcium channel blockers 59 Int J Environ Res Public Health 2020 17 2690 7 of 11 31 Prevention Prevention is so far the best practice in order to reduce the impact of COVID19 considering the lack of eective treatment At the moment there is no vaccine available and the best prevention is to avoid exposure to the virus 60 In order to achieve this goal the main measures are the following 1 to use face masks 2 to cover coughs and sneezes with tissues 3 to wash hands regularly with soap or disinfection with hand sanitiser containing at least 60 alcohol 4 to avoid contact with infected people 5 to maintain an appropriate distance from people and 6 to refrain from touching eyes nose and mouth with unwashed hands 61 Table 3 Interestingly the WHO issued detailed guidelines including I Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcoholbased hand rub or wash them with soap and water II Avoid touching eyes nose and mouth III Practice respiratory hygiene covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze IV If you have fever cough and diculty breathing seek medical care early V Stay informed and follow advice given by your healthcare provider VI Maintain at least 1 m 3 feet distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing 62 In particular regarding the use of face mask health care workers are recommended to use particulate respirators such as those certied N95 or Filtering FacePiece 2 FFP2 when performing aerosolgenerating procedures and to use medical masks while providing any care to suspected or conrmed cases 63 Moreover while an individual without respiratory symptoms is not required to wear a medical mask when in public people with respiratory symptoms are advised to use medical masks both in health care and home care settings 64 Table 3 Main Corona Virus Disease 2019 COVID19 prevention measures To use face masks To cover coughs and sneezes To wash hands regularly To avoid contact with infected people To maintain an appropriate distance from people To refrain from touching eyes nose and mouth In case of symptoms seek medical care early To follow advice given by your healthcare provider 32 Future Perspective The COVID19 outbreak is proving to be an unprecedented disaster especially in the most aicted countries including China Italy Iran and USA in all aspects especially health social and economic It is too early to forecast any realistic scenario but it will have a strong impact worldwide If high income countries especially those already aected by the outbreak seem to face a catastrophic perspective in lowincome countries there seem to be two possible scenarios In particular in the worstcase scenario when the COVID19 outbreaks the majority of countries will be unprepared with low resources allocated for aording the viral emergency and the consequences will be catastrophic In the best case scenario similarly to the global outbreak of the SARSCoV in 2003 also the COVID19 will not aect Africa or South America on a large scale suggesting that respiratory viruses spread more eectively in the winter and therefore the southern hemisphere will be aected later in the year if at all 63 To this could contribute also the climatespecic cultural dierences living more outdoors than indoors the eect of UV light on the survival of the virus on surfaces immunological dierences of the population innate immunity preexposure with coronaviruses or the higher temperatures 64 This data was also indirectly supported by Chin and colleagues that articially reproduced dierent environmental conditions in order to study the virus survival capacity 65 In addition to this hopeful low impact if the prevention measures will be implemented we could register a lower incidence of hygienelinked diseases that still represent leading causes of death 66 Int J Environ Res Public Health 2020 17 2690 8 of 11 4 Conclusions This review provides an insight into the COVID19 current situation and represents a picture of the current state of the art in terms of public health impact pathophysiology and clinical manifestations diagnosis case management emergency response and preparedness There is a rapidly growing body of literature on this topic and hopefully it will help in nding an eective vaccine and the best practice for the management and treatment of symptomatic cases Only once this pandemic ends one will be able to assess the health social and economic impact of this global disaster and we should be able to learn lessons especially in terms of public and global health for any future similar pandemics Author Contributions DP and LS conceived the idea
