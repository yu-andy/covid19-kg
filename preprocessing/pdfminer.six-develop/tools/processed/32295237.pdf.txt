SARSCoV2 suddenly emerged in early December 2019 SARSCoV2 resulted in being dramatically infectious with thousands of people infected In this scenario and without effective vaccines available the importance of an immediate tool to support patients and against viral diffusion becomes evident In this study we exploit the molecular docking approach to analyze the affinity between different viral proteins and several inhibitors originally developed for other viral infections Our data show that in some cases a relevant binding can be detected These findings support the hypothesis to develop new antiviral agents against COVID19 on the basis of already established therapies Keywords COVID19 SARSCoV2 coronavirus viral protease spike protein antiviral drug RNAdependent RNApolymerase viral protein N molecular modeling molecular docking 1 Introduction In early December 2019 a sudden and dramatic outbreak of a new Coronavirus strain named SARSCo V2 emerged in the continental Chinese area of Wuhan and quickly diffused throughout the country To date several cases of viruses were reported in Europe and in the US The SARSCoV 2 is strongly infectious with more than 81000 infected people and around 3000 deaths reported within three months from the virus appearance update on 14th of April more than 19 milion of confirmed cases and about 120 thousands deaths reported The rapid spread of the new virus reveals that the mechanism of diffusion is somehow different from that of Filoviridae ie Ebolavirus 1 The viral pathogenesis results in symptoms like fever acute pneumonia and eventually respiratory failure The death rate the long time needed for a full recovery and the comorbidity associated with viral infection ie in advanced age or particular life stages such as pregnancy result in a major threat to global health 2 In this scenario the need for a cure appears to be extremely urgent The main strategy against the diffusion of viruses is represented by the development of specific vaccines However the complexity of viruses and their ability to mutate and adapt to new host organisms belonging to other species has also led to different therapeutic approaches aimed to interfere with the viral life cycle or with processes essential for membrane fusion or replication 34 Furthermore computational chemistry represents a fundamental tool in the screening of applicable drugs 5 The computational approach can also represent a tool for physicians and healthcare professionals to operate a first decision on the best therapy to administrate at first instance Coronaviruses are singlestranded RNA enveloped viruses 67 whose genes encode among others for a trimeric structural spike protein a homodimeric cysteine proteinase 8 an RNA Viruses 2020 12 445 doi103390v12040445 wwwmdpicomjournalviruses Viruses 2020 12 445 2 of 13 polymerase and several nonstructural proteins httpswwwncbinlmnihgovnuccoreNC045512 9 From a phylogenetic point of view the genetic similarities shared by SARSCoV2 and the 2002 SARS coronavirus strain SARSCoV they both belong to the socalled beta CoV group and other batisolated coronaviruses strains have already been underlined with more than 96 gene identity 71011 The alignment of spike protein and protease showed an analogy in primary sequences of more than 75 610 and 96 respectively 612 Proteases and spike proteins are targets of choice for inhibition of SARS and MERS 1316 and several efforts have been made to develop inhibitors of their activities by using both virtual screening or experimental methods 515 In this work we present the results obtained for SARSCoV2 spike protein and 3 Clike protease by molecular docking of several inhibitors originally developed for antiviral therapy against other viruses such as the hepatitis C virus HCV and the human immunodeficiency virus HIV Thirteen proteinase inhibitors from ant iHIV and antiHCV drugs were investigated along with three different compounds for spike protein inhibition Despite the different viral strains for which these drugs were originally developed we aim to investigate whether they could also have an affinity for the SARSCoV2 The use of antivirals that are already available in the therapy against the new virus would be a huge advantage in the fight of this battle and a first step can eventually arise from bioinformatic analysis which could provide information about their potential effectiveness Indeed our in silico data suggest that an effective interaction occurs for some of the tested molecules These results represent a promising starting point for antiviral therapies that are alternative or coadjuvant to the vaccination strategy 2 Materials and Methods 21 Protein and Antiviral Drugs 211 Initial Sequences Protein sequences were obtained from the curated genomic sequence deposited at the Gene database with ID number NC045512 and were verified against SARSCoV ID NC0047183 17 the 3 Clike protease ID YP0097253011 the envelope spike protein ID YP0097243901 the RNA dependent RNApolymerase ID YP0097253071 and the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein ID YP0097243972 were selected The set of antiviral drugs was taken from the Influenza Research Database fludborg Potential inhibitors of SARSCoV2 protease were identified among all the antiprotease drugs in the mentioned database Asunaprevir DB 11586 Nelfinavir DB 00220 Simeprevir DB 06290 Faldaprevir DB 11808 Indinavir DB 00224 Ritonavir DB 00503 Amprenavir DB 00701 Tipranavir DB 00932 Atazanavir DB 01072 Saquinavir DB 01232 Darunavir DB 01264 Fosamprenavir DB 01319 Lopinavir DB01601 Furthermore three molecules were chosen for the spike protein Umifenovir DB 13609 Enfuvirtide DB00109 and Pleconaril DB05105 212 Compound Three Dimensional Structures The software OpenBabel 18 was used to convert the SMILES code of each molecule into a 3 D structural file The threedimensional structure of Enfuvirtide was taken from the available crystallographic structure PDB ID 3h00 chain A 213 Protein Structure Prediction Homology Modelling The homology model was performed with the i Tasser server giving as input the sequences obtained from the SARSCoV2 genomic sequence Model structures were energy minimized before the docking protocol by performing a short in vacuum 500 step steepestdescent optimization of the potential energy using GROMACS tools 19 Viruses 2020 12 445 22 Docking 3 of 13 Autodock Vina 20 was used to perform molecular docking of the antiviral drugs onto SARS CoV2 protease and envelope protein Regarding the protease residues 41 46 140 142 145 163 166 168 189 were set as flexibles during the binding mode search 21 About 3 Clike protease the binding box was centered on the coordinates of residue Met165 and it s volume fully encompassed the whole binding pocket For the spike envelope glycoprotein the box used for the search of binding modes was centered on the position of the center of mass of Val503 sidechain and restrained to the area above the extracellular head of the trimeric protein in the prefusion conformation 3 Results In the following paragraphs we will analyze and discuss the key properties of putative target proteins from SARSCoV2 in comparison with their homologs from SARSCoV We will focus in particular on four proteins the main 3 Clike protease the spike envelope glycoprotein the RNA dependent RNApolymerase RdRp the Nucleocapsid protein 31 3CLike Protease 311 Structural Analysis The 3 Clike protein is the main protease of SARSCoV2 It plays a fundamental role in RNA translation and thus as already underlined is essential for viral replication 12 In the mature form it is found as a dimer Each monomer is formed by three structural pseudodomains domain I residues 8101 domain II residues 102184 which share an antiparallel barrel structure and domain III residues 201303 which contains a fivefold antiparallel helix cluster 2223 The binding site for substrates is located in a cleft region between domains I and II and the catalytic region is formed by the dyad His41 Cys 145 that is highly conserved among the coronavirus proteases and is also reminiscent of the trypsinlike serine proteases 22 Importantly 3 CPro19 from SARSCoV2 shares a high similarity with its SARSCoV homolog 24 and only very few residues are substituted with respect to the SARS counterpart Thr35 Val Ala46 Ser Ser94 Ala Lys180 Asn Ala267 Ser Thr285 Ala Most of these residues are distant from the protease active site and are unlikely related to selectivity against this protease Figure 1 A Nonetheless two of these mutations Lys180Asn and Al a 46 Ser are located in the deep hydrophobic pocket below the active site and in the loop region flanking the entrance of the active site Although in the available crystallographic structure Ly s 180Asn results to be located too far to directly contribute to ligand binding its presence extends the hydrophobic inner region Conversely the Ser46 seems to be relatively distant from the His41 active site 11 and may have a role in ligand recruitment Figure 1B Viruses 2020 12 445 4 of 13 Figure 1 Structural features of 3 Clike protease from SARSCoV2 a Homology model structure with

Catalytic residues His41 Cy s 145 are shown in green Ala 46 Ser mutation is shown in orange on the SARSCoV2 structure 312 Docking Although a crystallographic structure of 3 Clike protease of SARSCoV2 in complex with a peptidelike inhibitor PDB id 6 LU7 was made very recently available in the Protein Data Bank this structure clearly shows a closed binding pocket around the inhibitor While very useful to identify the residues involved in the inhibitory action this configuration is not very well suited for molecular docking as it may limit the effectiveness of the pose searching methods For this reason we preferred to model the threedimensional structure of the protease using a homology modeling protocol excluding the complexed covid 19 protease among the target structures The structure obtained from the iTasser server showed a very good alignment score TMscore 0993 against the apo structure of SARSCoV main protease PDB ID 5B6O Interestingly the rootmeansquared deviation RMSD of the model structure from the available crystallographic structure SARSCoV2 protease is as low as 13 and it is mostly due to differences in the binding pocket and loop conformations The main results obtained from the docking protocol are shown in Table 1 Protease drug recognitions are usually driven by hydrophobic interactions 2425 and Figure 2 clearly shows how all the four best scoring ligands indeed thoroughly fill the hydrophobic pockets that flank the catalytic dyad Table 1 Results from molecular docking of thirteen different antiviral protease inhibitors The second column indicates the

Darunavir Fosamprenavir DB 01601 DB 11586 DB 01072 DB00220 DB00701 DB 01264 DB 01319 Surprisingly the wellknown HCV NS34A protease inhibitor Simeprevir 26 was identified as the best scoring drug with a significant difference with respect to some of the most promising inhibitors of SARSCoV2 protease identified such as Lopinavir 27 and Nelfinavir 28 HIV HCV HIV HIV HIV HIV HIV 81 81 80 79 77 76 72

Catalytic residues are colored in green N O C and S atoms are colored in blue red gray and yellow respectively Simeprevir fully fills two hydrophobic pockets flanking the catalytic dyad His41Cys 145 the macrocyclic compound fits in the pocket formed by residues in the range Phe 181 Phe 185 while the acyl sulfonamide cyclopropyl moiety points towards the region encompassing Leu27 Pro39 and Val42 This pose induces the opening of the catalytic dyad Indeed His41 Cys 145 changes from 3 in the apo configuration to 73 in the inhibited form Simeprevir binding to SARSCoV2 protease is also sustained by three hydrogen bonds that anchor the ligand to the binding pocket two of them link the amide backbone of Glu166 and Gly143 to the carbonyl O in the macrocycle and to the acyl sulfonamide cyclopropyl moiety respectively A third hydrogen bond is formed between the N of the As n 142 side chain and the ether group A detailed structural representation of the interacting residues is shown in Figure 3 A These findings may appear rather surprising as the HCV main protease shares very low similarity with the SARSCoV2 homolog 75 Nonetheless the two proteases share a very similar topology of the active site except for the hydrophobic loop Phe181 Phe185 which is structurally absent in the HCV protease Figure 3B Viruses 2020 12 445 6 of 13 Figure 3 Structural details of SARSCoV2 protease

N O C and S atoms are colored in blue red gray and yellow respectively 32 Envelope glycoprotein The socalled spike protein or S protein of SARSCoV2 is present within the envelope as a homotrimer like in the case of other enveloped viruses Each monomer features an ectodomain a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic tail Inhibitors are typically designed to interact with the upper part of the protein to interfere with the host membrane binding and with the fusogenic activity of the protein 321 Structural Features Several experimentally obtained structures for the multimeric conformation of SARSCoV spike protein are available PDB 5 WRG 5 58 5 XLR Homology model structure of SARSCoV2 spike protein was obtained from the i Tasser server Global pairwise sequence alignment indicated that SARSCoV2 spike protein shares about 76 of its primary sequence with its SARSCoV homolog with an overall similarity of 87 These few differences project into a slightly different negativepositive residue ratio 11599 in SARSCoV and 110103 in SARSCoV2 and a slightly less acidic p I 56 for SARSCoV 62 for SARSCoV2 Interestingly while this work was in progress the electron microscopy structure of the SARS CoV2 spike protein in its oligomeric prefusion inactive structure with a single receptorbinding domain up was made available by another group PDB id 6 VSB 29 Unfortunately a thorough direct comparison of our model structure with these experimental data is impaired by the different global configuration of the two trimeric structures downinactive vs upactive conformations However as the experimental structure shows only one monomer in the upstate a comparison can be performed in a monomerbased manner The RMSD between downstate monomers in the two structures is as low as 117 for residues with the same secondary structure assignments and 6 overall It is worth noting here that in the prefusion state the down inactive conformation is significantly more stable than the upconformations 3032 These findings confirm the quality of the homology model and its suitability for docking studies Visual inspection of the electrostatic potential of the downinactive conformation of SARS CoV2 spike protein Figure 4 ab shows that while the inner part of the protein that is proximal to the viral envelope is negatively charged the protein head is clearly characterized by a positive Viruses 2020 12 445 7 of 13 electrostatic potential This picture is rather different from one from SARSCoV Figure 4cd and thus it suggests an important property to which tailor future inhibitors Figure 4 Structural representation of the spike trimer from SARSCoV2 a Molecular surface of the trimer structure colored according to the local values of the electrostatic potential The color palette ranges from 10 kcalmole red to 10 kcalmole blue b Top view of the same representation as in panel A c Spike envelope protein from SARSCoV Same lateral view as in panel a d Top view of the same representation as in panel c 322 Docking The docking of three different inhibitors was performed on the spike protein As the inhibitors are expected to block the membrane binding we limited the docking search region to the area around the protein head in its prefusion down configuration Moreover due to the large size of the protein and to limit the computational cost we performed a rigid docking of the inhibitors against the target multimeric protein Autodock Vina was used to identify the best binding pose of three different drugs Umifenovir DB 13609 Enfuvirtide DB00109 and Pleconaril DB05105 The results are shown in Table 2 Interestingly upon binding Enfuvirtide interacts with spike protein whose cap is mainly positively charged through its negatively charged amino acids several glutamate residues As opposed to Enfuvirtide Figure 5 a which inhibits the viral spike protein action upon host membrane by interposing itself and avoiding contact between the protein and the cellular membrane the other two drugs docked at the entrance of the central channel pore formed by the trimeric structure Figure 5 bc Table 2 Results from molecular docking with Autodock Vina Inhibitor

RNA Dependent RNA Polymerase Viral polymerases share seven highly conserved motifs that are essentially involved in the nucleotidebinding and catalysis of RNA replication They are huge complex structures which act in association with several nonstructural proteins 33 331 Structural Properties Global pairwise sequence between SARSCoV2 RdRp and its SARSCoV counterpart shows a large sequence identity shared by the two proteins 94 with also a very high similarity 96 The analysis of RdRp and RNA primer complex displays that the RNAinteracting residues are conserved between SARSCoV and SARSCoV2 in red in Figure 6 a Viruses 2020 12 445 9 of 13 Figure 6 Structural representation of the RdRp monomer from SARSCoV2 a Superposition with the structure poliovirus RdRp in complex with RNA

according to the electrostatic potential 34 Nucleocapsid Protein The viral nucleocapsid protein N protein interacts with the viral genome and forms the ribonucleoprotein core It is now wellknown that this protein plays different roles in the viral infection as it is involved in the synthesis of viral RNA in the transcription of genomic RNA and in the translation of viral proteins 34 Coronavirus nucleocapsid proteins share a general structural pattern composed of three distinct domains an Nterminal domain 130 residues which is suggested to bind RNA a central domain 120 residues which is also predicted to recognize RNA and finally the Cterminal domain which drives the protein dimerization Although a complete structure of the nucleocapsid protein is not available for SARSCoV a local structural comparison can be performed by structure superposition of SARSCoV2 model structure with Nterminal and central domain in the SARS counterparts Figure 7 Sequence pairwise alignment of SARSCoV2 N protein against its SARSCoV homolog shows a very high identity in primary structure 91 with an overall similarity of 94 Figure 7 Structural representation of the homology model for

and with the dimerization domain of SARS RdRp in red PDB ID 2GIB 4 Discussion The modeling and superimposition of protease structure with the homologous SARS virus protease show very little differences although pivotal for the function The few residues different in SARSCoV2 protease assimilate the protein to a sort of sitedirected mutant of SARS protease Figure 1 The spike protein structure shows an upper trimeric cap supported by a stem domain with remarkable differences in terms of charge with a mainly positive ectodomain and a strongly negative stem domain Figure 4 In this respect stimulated by the important results in clinical trials of patients treated with antiretroviral agents 3536 we extended the investigation by a computational inspection of many different drugs and we chose a selection of most common antiviral drugs to display the probable molecular reasons of their efficacy in combined antiviral therapy The drugs examined include the HIV1 protease inhibitors mostly used in combination with other antiviral drugs in the treatment of HIV in both adults and children Moreover other antiviral drugs included in our screening show activity against the hepatitis C virus and good oral bioavailability One of the antiviral drugs tested against SARSCoV2 envelope protein is Enfuvirtide an HIV fusion inhibitor used in combination therapy for the treatment of HIV1 infection 37 The second molecule tested is Umifenovir an antiviral agent with activity against Influenza A and Bviruses 38 The last one is Pleconaril 39 used for prevention of asthma exacerbations and common cold symptoms in asthmatic subjects exposed to respiratory infections Pleconaril is orally bioavailable and active against Picornaviridae viruses The docking shows that 5 out of the 13 protease inhibitors are reported with a highscore in thermodynamic terms of a proteindrug complex 20 Table 1 and may be selected as the future core of new antiviral drugs specific for SARSCoV2 protease Intriguingly the docking of the spike protein shows interesting results for all the three drugs tested Notably Enfuvirtide is placed at the interface of two monomers in this position the molecule could impair the transition between closed and open state Figure 4 Finally it is worth mentioning that currently some of the drugs reported in Table 1 are used with satisfying results in therapies for the treatment of SARSCoV2 The RNAdependent RNApolymerase RdRp is one of the most important proteins involved in the genetic information replication and transmission of the coronavirus family viruses The function is accomplished by a multimeric complex of RdRp with nonstructural proteins favoring a sort of wrappingandscrolling of the viral genome The RdRp is very similar to the homologous of SARS Figure 6 The Nprotein promotes the package of viral genome into a helical ribonucleocapsid and virion assembly also interacting with membrane protein Consequently Nprotein plays an important role in viral RNA transcription as well as viral replication The dimerization domains of SARSCoV and SARSCo V2 share a high similarity Figure 7 The differences at protein structure level with the SARS the closest phylogenetic virus are intriguing and contribute to characterize the peculiarity of SARSCoV2 from coronavirus and influenza virus belonging to an oldscenario of virology taxonomy It is worth mentioning that several other groups are working on antiviralbased strategies to fight the new big threat represented by SARSCo V2 in some cases patients were treated with some of the molecules chosen for our studies ie Ritonavir Lopinavir Umifenovir 274042 these data strongly support and corroborate the results of our work 5 Conclusions Until now the exacerbation of COVID19 diffusion has stimulated the researchers and medical personnel to find a solution for the treatment compatible with the arsenal of antiviral drugs currently available Viruses 2020 12 445 11 of 13 At the same time in which we are closing the present manuscript the numbers are more than 81000 confirmed cases around 3000 deaths and a sensible increase of recovered people 30000 according to the Coronavirus COVID19 Global Cases by Johns Hopkins CSSE interactive map updated on 14th of April with more than 19 milion of confirmed cases and about 120 thousands deaths reported The first line strategy of isolation dramatic quarantine measurements and clinical treatments may be a reasonable positive warrant to limit the spread of the virus The four proteins taken into account are interesting molecular targets for the medicinal chemistry mainly the protease and the envelope or spike protein The antiviral drug therapy is an effective firststage approach for treating COVID19 infections and the present work could contribute to suggest to physicians the choice of the combination of antivirals to administer to patients alongside the hospitalization Obviously our knowledge in terms of the general organization of the structure of the virus particle is limited now but proteins like protease and spike are the primary molecular targets for drug discovery and development In the near future the availability of Xray crystal structures of the majority of proteins will allow a more exhaustive docking calculation on different classes of drugs eg antiparasitic drugs peptides The structural and computational studies and analysis are not subordinate but helpful for the comprehension of virus molecular elements and the right way to help the scientific community during the long
