acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 in China has been declared a public health emergency of international concern The cardiac injury is a common condition among the hospitalized patients with COVID19 However whether N terminal pro B type natriuretic peptide NTproBNP predicted outcome of severe COVID19 patients was unknown Methods The study initially enrolled 102 patients with severe COVID19 from a continuous sample After screening out the ineligible cases 54 patients were analyzed in this study The primary outcome was inhospital death defined as the case fatality rate Research information and followingup data were obtained from their medical records Results The best cutoff value of NTproBNP for predicting inhospital death was 8864 pgmL with the sensitivity for 100 and the specificity for 6667 Patients with high NTproBNP values 8864 pgmL had a significantly increased risk of death during the days of followingup compared with those with low values 8864 pgmL After adjustment for potential risk factors NTproBNP was independently correlated with inhospital death Conclusion NTproBNP might be an independent risk factor for inhospital death in patients with severe

hypersensitive troponin I hs TnI levels than others 7 A recent study demonstrated that the heart failure marker N terminal pro B type natriuretic peptide NT increased significantly during the course of proBNP hospitalization in those who ultimately died 6 How ever there is no research concerning whether NT proBNP predicted the outcome of severe COVID19 patients Methods Subjects The study initially enrolled 102 patients with severe COVID19 from a continuous sample in Hubei General Hospital during the management by national medical team The study is a retrospective observational registry with clinicaltrialsgov identifier NCT04292964 The study was also registered on Chinese medical research registration information system All procedures were followed the instructions of local ethic committee approval NO 20200701 Criteria for severe conditions included respiratory rate 30 min or rest oxyhemoglo bin saturation SPO2 93 or oxygenation index arter ial oxygen tension inspired

BNP level and the risk of inhospital death in severe COVID19 patients Severe COVID19 patients with high NTproBNP levels tended to be older with increased cardiac injury markers and higher levels of systematic inflammation markers Pa tients with high NTproBNP 8864 pgmL level had lower cumulative survival rate After adjusting for poten tial cofounders in separate modes NTproBNP pre sented as an independent risk factor of inhospital death in patients with severe COVID19 Previous studies have found that NTproBNP is a powerful and independent predictor of mortality in communityacquired pneumonia CAP 810 In these studies the best cutoff values of NTproBNP for predic tion 30 day mortality were 14345 pgmL and 17955 pg m L respectively 8 10 The elevated NTproBNP in these cases was believed owing to the cardiac complications re sulted from complex interactions among preexisting con ditions relative ischemia upregulation of the sympathetic systemic inflammation and direct pathogen system mediated damage to the cardiovascular system 11 However the cutoff value of NTproBNP to predict the adverse outcome of severe COVID19 patients was far lower than the threshold to diagnose heart failure 450 pgmL for 50 years 900 pgmL for 5075 years and 1800 pgmL for 75 years 12 in present study It was suggested that the prognostic effect of plasma NT pro BNP in severe COVID19 patients could not fully ascribe to heart failure induced by the virus or hypoxia Further understanding of physiological and pathological significance of plasma NTpro BNP elevation in severe COVID19 patients might help clinicians make corre to reduce the risks of adverse sponding decisions outcome NTproBNP is secreted in response to increased myo cardial wall stress 13 It is also controlled by acute injury and proinflammatory molecules such as renal lipopoly saccharide interleukin 1 Creactive protein and cardiotrophin I which are independent of ventricular function 14 15 It was consisted with the study finding that NTproBNP level was positively correlated to the makers of cardiac injury renal injury and systematic in flammation And these makers also constituted the risks of inhospital death according to the univariate Cox proportionalhazards regression analysis However NT pro BNP was an independent risk factor after accounting these factors in multivariate Cox The prognostic effect of NTproBNP might be a specific index of reflecting the overall state of SARSCoV2 infection Table 3 Results of multivariate Cox proportionalhazards regression analyzing the effect of baseline

still unclear From the result of autopsy by Xu and colleagues a few interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates were observed in heart biopsy indicating an inflammation induced cardiac injury 16 Other factors including the SARSCoV2 infec tion and invasion cardiomyocytes via the binding site of angiotensinconverting enzymerelated carboxypep tidase ACE2 17 the pulmonary infection induced inadequate oxygen supply to the myocardium and the influences of cytokine storm syndrome 1820 might also contribute to the cardiac injury 21 All these contributes to the elevation of NTproBNP and risks of poor prognosis in patients with COVID19 The virus itself may also elevate the NTproBNP level in COVID19 patients SARSCoV2 binds with ACE2 resulting the uncontrolled releasing of angio tensin 2 ANGII and restricted synthesis of ANG17 22 The latter exerts antiinflammation effect to pro tect tissue while ANGII plays in an opposite role and facilitates the secretion of NTproBNP 2224 It in dicated that NTproBNP level might associated with the severity of leading an adverse outcome which needs further verification infection thus By investigating the prognostic effect of NTproBNP level of severe COVID19 patients at admission it might be helpful to early identifying patients with poor progno ses However this study was limited by sample size and a single test of NTproBNP at admission Larger studies with continuous monitoring of NTproBNP are neces sary to further confirm the prognostic effect of NT proBNP in patients with severe COVID19 Conclusion In conclusion NTproBNP might be an independent risk factor for inhospital death in patients with severe COVID19 Supplementary information Supplementary information accompanies this paper at httpsdoiorg10 1186s1293102001352w Additional
