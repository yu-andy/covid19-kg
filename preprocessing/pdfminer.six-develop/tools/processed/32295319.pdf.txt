Myongji Medical Foundation Myongji Hospital Goyang Korea Recently the number of Corona Virus Disease 2019 COVID19 cases has increased remarkably in South Korea so the triage clinics and emergency departments ED are expected to be over crowded with patients with presumed infection As of March 21st there was a total of 8799 confirmed cases of COVID19 and 102 related deaths in South Korea that was one of the top countries with high incidence rates 1 This sharp increase in infection is associated with 1 out breaks in individual provinces 2 deployment of rapid and aggressive screening tests 3 dedicat ed healthcare staffs for virus screening tests 4 quarantine inspection data transparency and accurate data reporting and 5 public health lessons from previous Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome MERS outbreaks This commentary introduces innovative screening tests that are currently used in South Korea for COVID19 eg DriveThrough and WalkThrough tests and compare the advantages and disadvantages of both methods Keywords Infectious Disease Outbreak Virus Diseases Early Detection of Disease COVID19 di agnostic testing DriveThrough DT and WalkThrough WT tests are designed to provide a rapid screening have a minimal risk of infection and reduce excessive use of medical supplies like personal protective equipment PPE2 The risk of infection may be reduced by limiting the exposure of testees or di rect contacts between the testees and healthcare workers The DT tests are generally conducted in large lowtraffic areas such as public parking or stadium parking lot s 23 On the other hand the WT tests can be performed in a clean testing booth that can be installed near the hospital Table 1 shows the pros and cons of DT and WT testing for COVID19 DRIVETHROUGH DT TESTING FOR COVID19 Testing for COVID19 can be performed at a drivethrough site as shown in Figure 1 The driver testee can stay inside his car during the entire process 15 min consisting of multiple steps patient registration 34 min medical examination 2 min specimen collection 2 min dis charge instructions 2 min and payment for testing service 2 min Healthcare workers are sup posed to wear the level D PPE that is composed of inner and outer gloves a gown hooded cov erall an N95 mask respirator goggles eye shield or a face shield and safety shoes or boots Depending on the required contact level with patients or the availability of medical supply re sources healthcare staff may use PPE after modifying it following the facility guidelines 4 How to cite this article

DT and Walkthrough WT test for COVID19 DT testing WT testing Pros Efficiency Testing can be completed within 15 min Privacy protection The testee remains in hisher car during the entire process Reduced risk of infection Tests are conducted outdoors The car provides isolation to the testee No additional equipment There is no need for an extra isolation room or negative pres sure room Innovative screening tests for COVID19 in South Korea Negative pressure booth type Positive pressure booth type Efficiency Testing can be completed in about 20 min Reduced risk of infection Disinfection and ventilation of the booth should be done after every use and it can be done with relative ease Efficiency Testing can be completed in about 15 min Reduced risk of infection No need for disinfection and ventila tion of the booth Healthcare staffs do nt make any direct contact Healthcare staffs do nt make any di with the testees Prevent excessive use of medical supplies The booth walls separate healthcare staff from plies rect contact with the testees Prevent excessive use of medical sup testees so the use of medical supplies is reduced Reduced workload The workload for conducting the WT tests is less than the DT tests Robustness of method The booth is installed close or next to the hospital unit so testing is less likely to be affected by adverse weather conditions The booth walls separate healthcare staff from testees so the use of medical supplies is reduced Reduced workload The workload for conducting the WT tests is less than the DT test Test more patients Testing service is accessible even to Test more patients Testing service is accessible even to nondrivers It is possible to test multiple patients at once using more than one clean booth nondrivers It is possible to test multiple patients at once using more than one clean booth Medical consumerism A patient may get tested at multiple testing sites which can be seen as promoting medical consum erism Medical consumerism A patient may get tested at multiple testing sites which can be seen as promoting medical consumerism Risk of infection The risk of infection exists for the testees while heshe is waiting for the test in a reception area especially if overcrowded Risk of infection The risk of infection exists for healthcare staff for any equipment failure such as when the gloves tear The risk of infection exists for healthcare staff for any kind of equipment failures such as glove tears or perforation Adverse weather conditions Adverse weather conditions may complicate outdoors testing Cons Medical consumerism A patient may get tested at multiple testing sites which can be seen as promoting medical consumerism Additionally required supports Healthcare staffs will benefit from a support person who helps with writing orders and filling out medical records The testing site should be in the areas that are less populated but close enough to the hospital for future followup Worker fatigue Healthcare staff fatigue due to excessive workload Working outdoors 2 hours wearing the highlevel PPE can tire the staff to the level of fatigue so taking frequent breaks is rec ommended 6 Risk of infection The risk of infection exists related to possible handling errors of samples Healthcare staff may lose attention when changing gowns or gloves due to fatigue Testing capacity limitations Nondrivers can not use the testing service Crossinfection may occur between the driver and the pas senger so only one persondriver at a time should be tested per vehicle Adverse weather conditions Adverse weather conditions may complicate outdoors testing Cost The initial cost of the installation of a test site can be rela tively high 2 wwwceemjournalorg Sangchun Choi et al Fig 1 The Drivethrough DT testing site 1 Registration Healthcare staff assists the checkin process 2 Medical exam Healthcare staff records testees symptoms personal information and epidemiologic association The staff completes this process using a mobile phone without making contact with the testee If the testee is suspected of coronavirus infection hisher samples are collected before heshe gets transferred to a designated hospital 3 Collection of specimens Healthcare staff leans over the open window for naso and oropharyngeal swabs and then the testee closes hisher car win dows to collect hisher sputum specimen Car ventilation is set at the recirculation mode to minimize the risk of infection for healthcare workers After receiving the samples the healthcare staff puts on a new vinyl apron and disinfects hisher hands using alcoholbased hand sanitizer 4 Discharge instructions The testee gets the information about how to check the test result and is asked to selfquarantine until further notice regarding the outcome Instructions are also provided regarding what the testee should do if hisher symptoms get worse WALKTHROUGH WT TESTING FOR COVID19 Testing for COVID19 can be performed at a walkingthrough site as shown in Figure 2 Negative pressure booth In the WT test using a negative pressure booth the testee stays inside the disinfected booth while the healthcare worker is out side the booth disallowing a direct contact between the two The clean booth is designed to enclose the testee with transparent walls and a pair of gloves on one wall for healthcare staff to use when collecting patient samples and examining the patient Be fore the test healthcare staff is required to put on the PPE con sisting of a pair of gloves a gown and a disposable face mask The PPE can be adjusted to follow the facility guidelines or ac cording to the availability of medical supply resources The whole testing process from registration to payment can be completed in about 20 minutes Positive pressure booth The WT test using a positive pressure booth combines the advantages of the DT test and the WT test using a negative pressure booth The tester stays inside the booth while the testee stays outside thus di rect contact between the two is avoided Fig 3 The positive pressure booth looks similar to the negative pressure booth Positive pressure inside the booth is used to prevent contaminants from coming inside the booth The testing process is similar but shorter 10 min since it is unnecessary to disinfect the booth after each test Clin Exp Emerg Med 2020 Apr 16 3

the healthcare staff is outside the booth the whole time The booth was designed with transparent walls one of which has a pair of long gloves for a healthcare worker to use to make naso and oropharyngeal swabs The testee collects the sputum sample by himselfherself in the closed booth The testee then receives information about how to check the test result and how to selfquarantine Instructions are also provided regarding what the testee should do if hisher symptoms get worse After the exit of the testee the booth gets ventilated and disin fected for 2 minutes the first time and 10 minutes after that 4 wwwceemjournalorg Sangchun Choi et al Fig 3 The Walkthrough WT test using the positive pressure booth7 1 Medical exam Healthcare staff records testees symptoms personal information and epidemiologic association The booth is installed in a tent or a container house separated from the hospital The staff can complete this process using a mobile phone without making

caused by viruses have tended to break out once every decade or every other decade over the past 300 years 5 Now they may be occurring more often and in more variable cycles Successful management of viral infection and diseases requires quarantine and treatment of those who may have an infection Thus earlystage screening tests that are efficient and effective are essential for preventing the virus from spreading widely Each step of the testing process should be completed quickly and mini mize the existing risk of infection for healthcare workers and tes tees alike meeting the general safety requirements In this commentary we introduce innovative screening testing that has been successfully applied to the COVID19 outbreak in South Korea Although the efficacy of the methods should be fur ther clarified we believe that our experience with a successful implementation of these tests for COVID19 may apply to other countries REFERENCES 1 Korean Centers for Disease Control and
