view of COVID19 A patients mother contacted our Schizophrenia Outpatient Clinic as soon as news about the coronavirus pandemic reached Brazilian headlines I immediately remembered how we hear in mental health services that patients with severe mental illness are immune decient But is this true What are the implications of the COVID19 pandemic for schizophrenia patients and their families Coronavirus disease COVID19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 has affected over 750000 people worldwide and has led to 36405 deaths 1 becoming a major concern for all health systems Although the global prevalence of schizophrenia is D 042 it represents a large burden to families and society These patients also have high mortality rates and comorbid medical conditions If they are more susceptible to SARSCoV2 infection have worse clinical outcomes once contaminated or have psychotic relapses in the con text of the COVID19 pandemic there will be an additional burden to a system that is already pressed to the limit To help families and policy makers make better informed decisions and develop preventive measures we intend to address the following questions Are schizophrenia patients at higher risk of 1 being contaminated 2 mortality and 3 suffering a psychotic relapse Regarding the rst question we performed a literature review through Medline searching from inception to March 16 2020 We included original peerreviewed articles in English assessing any diagnosis of respiratory infection regardless of causal agent among schizophrenia patients All 315 reports were screened blindly by two authors in two phases title and abstract and fulltext review resulting in 18 articles selected for data retrieval Few reports specically addressed viral infections Over all the articles suggested higher odds of pneumonia and mortality Although communityacquired pneumonia is non transmissible it could indicate immunodeciency 34 Thus our search indicated that this population could be at higher risk of developing respiratory infections especially when Correspondence Ary Gadelha Laboratorio Interdisciplinar de Neuro ciencias Clnicas LiNC

2020 comorbid medical conditions and lifestyle risk factors are involved Older age and clinical comorbidities increase mortality rates among COVID19 patients 5 More than 70 of all schizophrenia patients also have one or more clinical con ditions 6 including diabetes type II78 pulmonary chronic disease9 and hypertensioncoronary heart diseas e 1011 Smoking estimates among schizophrenia patients vary from 50 to 9012 compared to 2030 in the general popu lation and involve higher smoking intensity another poten tial risk factor for respiratory complication s 13 although it is not yet clear whether COVID19 outcomes are worse among smoker s 14 Spirometric assessment indicates that schizophrenia patients have impaired lung function and they are more often diagnosed with restrictive and obstruc tive pulmonary diseases 15 In addition when hospitalized for pulmonary conditions schizophrenia patients have higher rates of intensive care unit admissions acute respiratory failure mechanical ventilation and inhospital death than other patients 16 They also have a higher risk of acute organ dysfunction than the general population when admitted to the intensive care unit regardless of cause 16 Overall most schizophrenia patients would t at least one known risk group for COVID19 and if admitted to a hospital should be considered at increased risk of worse clinical outcomes Although this review did not yield a denite answer to our questions the contextual data lead us to infer that there is a greater infection risk in schizophrenia patients Quarantine has been proven necessary when a site reaches a certain level of COVID19 contamination and it has been decisive in positive outcomes especially when implemented early 17 Due to its transmission character istics COVID19 requires both respiratory and contact isolation 18 Schizophrenia patients appear to have greater difculty following adequate hygiene practices than the general population19 Oral hygiene decits have been parti cularly well documented20 and could certainly increase vul nerability to respiratory disease s 21 Schizophrenia inpatients How to cite this article Fonseca L Diniz E Mendonca G Malinowski F Mari J Gadelha A Schizophrenia and COVID19 risks and recommendations Braz J Psychiatry 202000000000 httpdxdoiorg1015901516444620200010 2 L Fonseca et al Table 1 Recommendations for health professionals and families regarding schizophrenia patients 1 Schizophrenia patients should follow the same health instructions eg inuenza vaccine unless specic restrictions apply and receive the same treatment as clinical highrisk groups for COVID19 2 General practitioners treating COVID19 patients should pay special attention to those with schizophrenia since they could minimize or have difculty describing respiratory symptoms 3 Mental health professionals should remotely monitor unstable outpatients and when possible use telehealth internetbased technologies to provide more frequent clinical contact and support for emerging concerns 4 Mental health services should inform patients and families of all procedures to be followed during this period and should provide clear remote contact channels to minimize overcrowding and exposure However families should monitor for signs of relapse and contact mental health services as soon as possible 5 Professionals and families should promote and monitor adherence to antipsychotic medication regimens as well as ensure access to prescriptions perhaps organizing a delivery system It should also be emphasized that patients should continue regular medication regimens including clozapine 6 To reduce emotional distress and possibly psychotic relapse families and patients should be advised to Anticipate stress reactions and be informed about them by professionals Prepare for quarantine which can be better adhered to if patients and families receive more information about the disease about the benets of quarantine both personally and in terms of public health and about quarantine procedures such as adequate supplies of food and medication 26 Limit media exposure since overexposure to broadcasts of stressful situations has been linked to negative mental health outcomes 27 and avoid misinformation In as much as possible develop new routines that include leisure activities and physical exercise are at additional risk due enclosed treatment environ ments Consequently impaired judgement and poor self care two features commonly observed in schizophrenia could hinder compliance with health recommendations and put patients their families and health professionals at risk However beyond the direct risk of Lower access to adequate medical care 22 one possi ble explanation for increased mortality in schizophrenia could also aggravate this scenario Patients and their families may have more difculty identifying the initial symp toms of COVID19 and seek health services In addition even if they do request medical assistance there is a higher chance they will not receive proper assessment or treatment due to the stigma surrounding schizophrenia23 infection could COVID19 indirectly lead to relapse among schizophrenia patients The main collective sanitary strategy for preven ting contamination is social isolation which could generate considerable distress both for patients and caregiver s 2425 As a result lack of access to regular psychosocial inter ventions or medication and subsequent reduced adher ence could of course increase the chances of psychotic symptoms which is a major concern Nonetheless we beli eve that exposure to such a stressful life event changes of routine and interpersonal anxiety due to prolonged quar antine or even the fear of contracting the disease could also act as important triggers To the best of our knowledge no study has provided details on COVID19 prevalence or outcomes in schizo phrenia patients However we believe that the available evidence suggests they 1 May have more difculty following quarantine and respi ratory etiquette procedures and thus are at higher risk of contamination 2 Are at higher risk of poor COVID19 outcomes mainly due to higher comorbidity rates and a possible immuno deciency associated with schizophrenia 3 Are at higher risk of relapse considering the emotional distress added to an already vulnerable group during an infectious disease outbreak their limited access to community care and the risk of interrupting medication Such risks vary from patient to patient according to clinical comorbidities cognitive impairment acute symp toms and family support which can inuence disease severity and general health conditions Thus we have produced a list of suggestions Table 1 that combine current recommendations for COVID19 pre vention httpswwwwhointemergenciesdiseasesnovel coronavirus2019technicalguidance and the particulari ties of schizophrenia In conclusion schizophrenia patients are at higher risk of infection and worse outcomes especially if affec ted by clinical comorbidities They are also vulnerable to worsening psychiatric symptoms and relapse due to fear of the disease stress and the boredom associated with compulsory isolation Therefore health professionals and families should provide extra attention and support to prevent COVID19 infection among individuals with schizophrenia and should detect both respiratory and psychiatric symptoms as early as possible Acknowledgements This study was nanced in part by the Coordenaca o de Aperfeicoamento Pessoal de Nvel Superior CAPES Finance Code 001 The
