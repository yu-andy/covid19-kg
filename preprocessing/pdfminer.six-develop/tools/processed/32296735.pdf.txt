Center for Biomedical Ethics Fudan University Shanghai 200433 China On Feb 21 2020 a research group from the University of Bern published a paper titled Rapid reconstruction of SARSCoV2 using a synthetic genomics platform 1 on the preprint platform BioRxiv which has not been evaluated by peer review Based on the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 COVID19 sweeping the world the authors claimed to have been able to engineer and resurrect chemicallys ynthesized clones of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 with a yeastbased synthetic genomics platform This paper presents the genetic reconstruction of diverse RNA viruses including the novel coronavirus The authors believe that with the use of this platform generation of SARSCoV2 from chemically synthesized DNA could bypass the limited availability of virus isolates to allow genetic modifications and functional characterization of individual genes as well as to generate serological diagnostics to develop and assess antivirals and vaccines and to establish appropriate in vivo models During this critical period of global research and emerging combat with this epidemic disease the present research could contribute to the development of antiviral therapeutics and that of a vaccine The authors of the aforementioned paper claim to have taken into consideration the dualuse problem The socalled dualuse problem in biology denotes that the techniques needed to engineer a bioweapon are the same as those needed to pursue legitimate research 2 For example the pathogen synthesis technique can be used to rescue patients as well as to possibly manufacture Corresponding author Email address wguoyufudaneducn bioweapons Even if the motivation for the development of this type of technology is noble any deviation misuse or abuse during the research may result in calamitous consequences for instance an accidental leak from the laboratory or the purposeful misuse by others The chemically synthesized SARSCoV2 virus is a part this type of technology with the benefits mainly including the acceleration of therapeutics and vaccine development and the protection of human life and health from the virus However the risks include the following 1 Owing to the fact that SARSCo V2 is a virus with high transmissibility and susceptibility there exists a biosecurity risk wherein bioterrorists could exploit this characteristic with potentially hazardous consequences 2 By publishing the technology roadmap it is possible for scientists and terrorists to be able to apply the same technique to synthesize more complex viruses 327 or to develop a super virus with extremely high infectivity virulence or vaccineresistant Currently internet has made it easier to order the related biological materials that could potentially be used to synthesize bioweapons 3 Accidental leakage of synthesized virus particles from the laboratory increases biosafety risks threatening the safety of humans as well as that of the ecological environment In view of these risks the international scientific community had previously reached an agreement on the development of dualuse techniques First based on the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological Biological and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction better known as The Biological Weapons Convention BWC effective since March 1975 and the existing international laws and regulations the research and development of dualuse biotechnology must guarantee safety and security and never in any circumstance be used to harm the safety of individuals and the society at large The convention and the relevant laws and regulations draw a red line for dualuse biotechnology research to ensure morality of duty 4 and also to serve as the bottom line for the development of biological science Second dualuse biotechnology must promote scientific independent innovation while ensuring the protection of social safety The two basic values of safetysecurity and intellectual freedom of research must be considered evenly Therefore countries all over the world are promoting biotechnological innovation while stressing equally on the importance of biosafety and biosecurity legislation To reduce the predictable risks caused by the dualuse of biotechnology as much as possible it is necessary to take the following into consideration before development of any highrisk technology 1 Whether it is essential to undertake the research and to undertake it now Whether there exist other alternative technologies as in whether it is necessary and urgent 2 Whether and how to undertake the implemention of mandatory safetysecurity measures 3 Whether and how to compulsorily certify the technology 4 Whether and how to educate and train researchers 5 Whether and how to investigate the reliability of the researchers 6 Whether and how to oversee the publication and propagation of the research results How to answer the above questions on the basis of balancing the value of For example Regulation of Research into Biological Disease Agents Act of Israel Public Health Security and bioterrorism preparedness response act of the US Safety management measures for biotechnology research and development of China etc The socalled morality of duty lays down the basic rules without which an ordered society is impossible or without which an orderly society fails to achieve certain essential goals Such moral norms can be regarded as a synonym of state law The violation of such rules will lead to the punishment of the states coercive power safetysecurity and intellectual freedom and risk assessment depends on which subjects own the biosafetybiosecurity regulation rights and depends on which standard technique and behavioral norm to carry out According the rights distribution on biosafetybiosecurity regulation there are five theoretical and practical decisionmaking models ranging from an individual researcher to a complete government agency 36364 to previous research from the perspective of There would exist some problems when the allocation of regulation rights is located too far on the left or right side of the above axis Individual scientists and research institutions located on the left may emphasize too much on the value of technological development during the determination of the value tradeoff and they may also lack the professional ability to assess the economic political and ethical issues arising from the development of a specific biotechnological innovation On the right side of the axis government agencies often lack professional judgment on rapidly changing biotechnology they may overemphasize the value of social safetysecurity and their strict adherence to formal norms is not beneficial for flexible casebycase decisionmaking However in the case of the independent regulatory agencies consisting of scientists ethicists jurists and government regulators due to the diversity of their decisionmaking members they are able to undertake a comprehensive review of the process of knowledge acquisition from the perspectives of science economy politics and law and balance the value between social safetysecurity and technological development With respect to the norms of biosafetybiosecurity regulation owing to the rapid progress of biological research it is difficult for regulators and researchers to design or construct clear and specific systems for the measurement or ranking of the variable values of science economics politics and ethics involved in research Therefore even if a particular research action complies with the law it does not mean that it is ethically responsible To achieve responsible research it is necessary to supplement the deficiencies of the hard law with the more flexible voluntary and ethical soft law so as to promote the voluntary participation of diverse groups and the action of the safety committee within the research institution and to encourage the relevant personnel to comply with the morality of aspiration or the challenge of excellence 4 As observed in the ethical statement from the research group of the University of Bern there was Responsible research includes but is not limited to research with irreplaceable necessity research behaviors with sufficient goodness and research value with an optimal balance between risks and benefits The socalled morality of aspiration is the morality of the Good Life of excellence of the fullest realization of human powers The violation of such a moral norm does not lead to the punishment of the state but to the publics evaluation of his or her quality In such a case man or woman would be condemned for shortcoming instead of wrong doing an assessment of the benefits and risks involved in the synthesis of SARSCoV2 virus 11516 Regarding dualuse biological research Switzerland utilizes the regulation mode where an independent biosafety committee and government agencies share the determination right the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health FOPHand the relevant ethics committee the Swiss Expert Committee for Biosafetyin this case and other regulators the Federal Office for Environment and the Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office in this case communicate and negotiate and finally the FOPH gives permission according to the review of the aforesaid institutions However it is unclear whether the balance between social safetysecurity and biotechnological innovation has been sufficiently evaluated and whether the representative public participation has been absorbed before acquiring administrative permission due to the brief ethical statement In fact there has always existed controversy pertaining to the gainoffunction research on engineering viruses in the scientific community In 2011 Ron Fouchier of Erasmus Medical Center the Netherlands and Yoshihiro Kawaoka at the University of Wisconsin Madison USA separately performed the genetic alteration of the H5 N1 virus which was found to be easily transmissible between ferrets through the air Fouchier claimed that it was probably one of the most dangerous viruses you can make 5 Regarding this scientists and critics believed that this highly transmissible virus could cause a huge risk to human beings if it was accidentally leaked or was misused by bioterrorists 5 In 2014 the US Government instituted a pause on funding for any new studies that included certain gainoffunction experiments involving influenza severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome MERS viruses and encouraged those currently conducting this type of work to voluntarily pause their research while the risks and benefits were being reassessed by the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity NSABB and the National Research Council NRC 6 From the perspective of responsible development of biotechnology regarding to the risk assessment of a highly dangerous virus like SARSCoV2 it is necessary to clarify the items of risk assessment For instance whether the yeastbased synthetic genome method in the paper is irreplaceable in the development of therapeutics or a vaccine If there are alternative safe methods to develop a vaccine and select therapeutics with recombinant DNA technology such as recombinant viral protein production of a pseudovirus or transfection with mRNA fragments of viral structure proteins why should such a huge risk be undertaken Especially the risk of this virus reconstruction technique transformationassociated recombination TAR is in the production of not only the novel coronavirus but also other dangerous RNA viruses such as other coronaviruses and the Zika virus ZIKV Faced with the situation where other laboratories or universities such as the University of North Carolina are also trying to create a copy of the virus from scratch 7 how can we ensure that this technology is not misused or abused in the future For such technologies which can be easily applied or converted to risk the risk of publication needs to be strictly assessed for example whether to publish to which group of people and under what circumstances could the research be published In addition how should we compare and quantify which groups will benefit and which groups will undertake the risk and what is the More information can be seen in httpswwwbagadminchbagenhomehtml More information can be seen in httpswwwefbsadminchenhomepage criterion of determination Whether scientists have enough expertise and intelligence to fully assess the dualuse risks of a synthesized virus including the assessment of the motivation condition and capability of bioterrorists to acquire SARSCoV2 or to design and synthesize it 354 Once the risks become a reality who or which organization should take responsibility for them Whether it is sufficient to deal with and resolve the risk only depending on the responsibility after the event Furthermore the ratio of benefits to risks is not only a scientific issue but also involves differences in risk perception and value judgment of different subjects the views about the risks involved often differ between the experts and the public Then which subjects risk sense should be taken into consideration in the prior ethical review and for the determination of the value balance between social safetysecurity and biotechnological innovation According to the AREA theoretical framework 8 which was proposed by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council of the UK EPSRC on the basis of Responsible research and Innovation RIRRI it s contents include Anticipation Reflection Engagement and Action AREA We believe that research transparency and public participation are very important in the research of pathogen synthesis technology Scientists and regulators should cooperate with the public and other stakeholders to encourage dialogue with the public to address key issues such as public acceptability Although scientific research requires a spirit of freedom and autonomy for such dualuse biotechnology with a highrisk potential no single scientist and scientific community can undertake the responsibility once the risks materialize into real dangers For that reason in addition to enhancing the selfgovernment and selfdiscipline of scientists and scientific communities government supervision must be reinforced laws and regulations should be improved and global regulation framework ought to be constructed Therefore we appeal to scientists to be highly prudent and responsible while undertaking the research and development involving pathogen synthesis technologies We share the same earth interests risks and destiny and therefore we are supposed to assume equal responsibility to protect our world The whole world should join hands and overcome the challenge posed by this novel virus together Only through joint participation and effective regulation can we guide dualuse technologies like engineering SARSCoV2 to benefit human society Acknowledgements This work was supported by research grants from the
