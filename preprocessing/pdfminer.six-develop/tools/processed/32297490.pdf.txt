Federico II 2 Spedali Civili Brescia 3S GiovanniAddolorata Hospital Rome Italy The ongoing COVID19 pandemic spreading all around the world has stressed over its capabilities and determined profound changes in the health systems in all countries and has caused hundreds of thousand deaths Health professionals have been called to a tremendous effort to deal with this emergency often contaminating or succumbing themselves to the disease Patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease infected with COVID19 have an increased risk of severe disease and worse outcome including death Patients with COVID19 infections have profound involvement not only of the pulmonary system but also variegate involvement of other organs multi organ failure MOF particularly of cardiovascular system mainly through acute hypoxic myocardial injury myocarditis arterial and venous thromboembolism 1 Intensive or subintensive care units have carried the greatest load but several hospital wards have been reconverted to COVID units particularly internal medicine or specialties like cardiology or pneumology to face the growing wave of the disease This revolutionary transformation has had a strong implication for cardiology Many cardiology units or Coronary Care Units CCU have been downsized and induced to allocate dedicated space and personnel to emergency COVID units or ICU But COVID19 storm has also had a deep impact for cardiac rehabilitation CR some CR units have been closed and medical or nurse staff moved to COVID units others have seen a reduction of beds or staff thus limiting their operative capabilities To understand how Italian CR units are being remodulated in this pandemia the Italian Association of Cardiac Prevention and Rehabilitation IACPR has launched an online survey on the impact of COVID19 on their activity whose results will be the basis for prospecting different actions at national level and to understand the best way to reorganize the activities during and after the storm of the disease 2 COVID19 has had profound implications on the organization of CR also in other European countries in many cases reducing or stopping CR programs Hansen D and

different burden of the disease with many differences among Italian regions IACPR has issued general recommendations for CR activities during COVID19 pandemia 3 In general active CR centers have seen in these days a reduced referral to residential CR from the traditional prevalent source cardiac surgery PTCA or other planned interventions usually referred to CR such as Pacemaker ICDCRT implantations since all these elective activities have been postponed in large part As far as Phase 2 outpatients CR many elective inhospital activities or outpatient sessions or visits have been postponed in the last 2 months In addition reduction of ACS admissions to CCU has occurred since many patients refuse hospitalization or do not reach the hospital in time or die at home While the total admission to CCU has been largely reduced the proportion of STEMI vs NSTEMI has increased indicating that only the worse ACS patients those with worse symptoms are reaching the hospital while many patients with fewer symptoms prefer to stay at home Similarly many heart failure HF patients avoid hospital admission even if the clinical status is worsening However In those patients who are referred and admitted to CR the organization provision and delivery of rehabilitative programs must be remodulated in COVID19 era according to the recommendations recently issued by the CR section of European Association of Preventive Cardiology EAPC 4 The more relevant of these recommendations are establishing priorities for referral to CR increase patients turnover adopt appropriate precautions during training masks distancing avoid group exercises shorten the programs keep track of discharged patients and follow them with remote assessment In the medium time scenario the challenge for CR units will be to be prepared to face for some time a population of patients at higher cardiovascular risk than usual this will be composed of patients with ACS STEMI or NSTEMI or with worsening HF not hospitalized for the acute event due to missed diagnosis or patient refusal Many of these patients may have had reduced out of hospital attention from the practitioner or the specialist which at this time are mostly focused on COVID19 treatment leading to inadequate secondary prevention with poor drug adherence and traditional risk factors control thus allowing progression of underlying cardiovascular disease In addition many ACS patients may have had a late admission to CCU due temporary shortage of ambulance availability leading to delayed or unsuccessful revascularization Occasionally some patients are having systemic thrombolysis revascularization Accordingly all these circumstances may most likely lead to the growth of a ACS population resembling that of prePTCA era with more frequent STEMI left ventricular systolic dysfunction andor HF poorer physical function for longer inactivity and poorer prognosis CR strategies and programs should therefore be tailored on the peculiarities of these patients who are at higher risk and with the majority of them being elderly and often frail than percutaneous rather Monaldi Archives for Chest Disease 2020 901315 page 205

cardiac patients who have developed COVID19 infection during admission in medical or surgical units for ACS HF cardiac surgery etc and thereafter discharged and referred to CR Of course strict rules should be established for these referrals that should be reserved only to infected patients after COVID19 swabs are negative and chest imaging recovered and to those at higher risk who need residential CR for stabilization of an acute coronary event and for whom immediate return at home may be dangerous Of interest while the acute cardiovascular complications of COVID19 infection are recognized term consequences on cardiovascular recovery after an acute event are still largely unknown Coronavirus infection may largely affect cardiovascular and other systems and these aspects may complicate the clinical handling and even the modalities of rehabilitative programs or drug strategies in these patients A closer link with other specialists mainly lung and thrombosis specialists will allow to face up to these unprecedented clinical scenarios it s medium long to Another side of the coin is how to deal with patients unlikely but possible developing COVID19 infection during residential CR In this setting CR Units should be prepared to implement all protections for health professionals patients contact and relatives including isolating the infected stopping rehabilitative program and to make difficult choices on the best discharge destination home quarantine cardiology or COVID wards depending from the more severe cardiologic or pneumologic clinical damage In summary COVID19 infection outbreak is having and will likely have for a long period a profound impact on CR organization and provision of CR programs Cardiology and Cardiac Rehabilitation scientific societies should be prepared to face this new challenge particularly by reeducating cardiac patients to refer to cardiologic services in case of worsening of the underlying disease and reinforcing the need of maintaining secondary prevention despite all difficulties in order to reduce as much as possible the negative functional and prognostic impact of COVID 19 infection in cardiovascular patients
