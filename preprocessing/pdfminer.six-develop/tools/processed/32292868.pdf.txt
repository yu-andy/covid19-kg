new coronavirus COVID19 spread widely in China and a large number of people became infected At present the domestic outbreak has been effectively controlled while the new coronavirus is spreading rapidly in other areas Currently Europe has become the center of the current outbreak of new pneumonia Meanwhile on March 11 the World Health Organization WHO declared a new pneumonia outbreak a global pandemic The new coronavirus has caused a great threat to the health and safety of people all over the world due to its amazing spreading power and potential harm The research on the domestic and international epidemics and the future development trend has become a hot topic of current research At present many teams have studied the transmission law and preventive measures of the COVID19 Corman et al 2020 Hui et al 2020 Rothe et al 2020 and many meaningful results have been obtained Mizumoto Chowell 2020 Riou Althaus 2020 Shao Wu 2020 According to the transmission characteristics of epidemic at different stages this paper uses Gaussian distribution theory to construct a new model of coronavirus transmission By simulating the propagation process of the COVID19 we found that the curves of proposed model well simulate the ofcial data curves of Hubei NonHubei area of China and also South Korea Italy and Iran The study points out the key factors that affect the spread of the virus such as the basic reproduction number Corresponding author Corresponding author Email addresses penghaipengbupteducn H Peng yshaobjmueducn Y Shao Peer review under responsibility of KeAi

development trend of epidemics in different regions and infer the time of the initial cases Furthermore we analyzed the impact of different control times on the spread of the epidemic Relevant models and data analysis can provide some basis and guidance for the related countries about epidemic prevention and control The main contributions of this paper can answer the following 11 questions and be summarized as Epidemic situation in Hubei Province of China 1 When will more than 10000 conrmed coronavirus cases be completely cured in Hubei The model predicts that almost all cases will be cured before April 1 Fig 1 2 When was the earliest case in Hubei We nd that there was already infections on November 24 Fig 2 3 How many people are infected per person Basic reproduction number It is 38

advance how much is the infection What if control is lagging 5 days If 5 days in advance the number of infected people will be 28000 42 of the current number of conrmed cases If the control is delayed for 5 days it will reach 156000 people 226 times of the current level 68000 in Hubei at March 13 Fig 5 6 What distribution does the daily infection curve satisfy which day reaches the peak is February

epidemic situation in South Korea is basically under control According to the model South Korea will be basically under control by the end of March It was found on January 7 that there was infection in South Korea conrmed by ofcial broadcast January 20 In addition we found that the basic reproduction number before the control was 42 in Korea and 01 after the control Fig 8 L Li et al Infectious Disease Modelling 5 2020 282e292 287 Fig 8 Comparison of Korean epidemic simulation data and ofcial data The curve aNumber of simulated infections The curve bNumber of ofcially conrmed infections In March 13 15000 people in Italy are infected If not controlled it will increase dramatically It will reach 250000 by the end of March In fact Italy began to control on March 8 According to Chinas basic reproduction number 05 when city is closed it will reach 100000 by the end of March The basic reproduction number in Italy is 38 before control According to the model inversion the infection was found on January 10 in Italy 2 cases were conrmed by the ofcial broadcast January 31 Fig 9 In March 13 11000 people are infected in Iran Our model predicts that it will reach 33000 people at the end of March through backward inference of the epidemic situation we found that Iran had an infection on January 11 ofcially reporting that two cases died on February 20 and there was no ofcial data before The model found that the basic reproduction number in Iran before the control was 38 Fig 10 Fig 9 Comparison of Italy epidemic simulation data and ofcial data The curve aNumber of simulated infections

data of Hubei Province is large httpwjwhubeigovcn more in line with the statistical law and the statistical model is more able to reect the process of virus transmission so we build a statistical model for the epidemic situation of Hubei Province see the method section later for details Based on the data provided by National Health Com mission of China NHCC we have carried out accurate simulation By comparing the simulation results with the real data we analyze the propagation process and its inuencing factors 21 Simulation comparison of epidemic model in Hubei Province According to the comparison between the ofcial epidemic data and simulation data of Hubei Province see Fig 1 for details we can see that the model simulation curve of the number of conrmed infections the number of cured people and the number of dead people matches the ofcial data curve very well According to the curve of simulated number of infected persons and the curve of ofcial number of infected persons we can see that there is a certain gap between the number of infected persons before February 12 and the others are basically the same after the ofcial announced the method of clinical diagnosis of pneumonia on February 12 the data on that day surged to 14000 indicating that the ofcial data had some omissions before February 12 and our model give a more accurate response to the number of actual cases 22 Simulation of the number of infected people According to the curve of simulated infection number we infer that by the end of March yellow line light blue line dark blue line Number of simulated cures Number of simulated deaths Number of simulated infections all cases will be basically treated that is to say more than 10000 cases in Hubei will be basically cured and cleared Note the number of cases of infection on December 24 is not zero Because the data in Fig 1 is too large small data can not be displayed For this reason according to the same distribution curve we also give the simulation data results before December 24 and the simulation found that the initial infected people had existed as early as November 24 see Fig 2 for details The rst conrmed infection was reported on December 8 httpwwwstdailycom 23 Simulation of the number of the average infected people The basic regeneration number has a great inuence on the spread of the outbreak As the number of basic regeneration increases the total number of people infected will also increase and the greater the number of basic regeneration the faster the disease will spread As in the previous simulation there are three phases The rst phase is an uncontrolled phase Through a large number of simulations we found that the basic regeneration number is 38 and the second and third phases are controlled phases The basic regeneration numbers are respectively It is 05 and 01 see the yellow line in Fig 3 The simulated curve yellow line can be closer to the ofcial diagnosis curve red line in Hubei The rst stage is the free propagation stage and we also give other simulation results of the basic regeneration number in the range of 3e46 the L Li et al Infectious Disease Modelling 5 2020 282e292 289 second and third stages remain unchanged The effect of transmission is signicant with the most accurate nal infections being obtained only at 38 As for the basic regeneration number in the stage of free propagation some scholars have proposed that it should be between 2839 or 3674 Read et al 2020 Obviously these expressions are either inaccurate or too wide 24 Simulation of the average latency Fig 4 shows the comparison chart of the average incubation period We simulated the days in the range of 3e 9 respec tively and found that when the average incubation period was set to 6 days it could better t the ofcial curve while the other simulated values are quite different from the ofcial curves It is also found that the shorter the incubation period the faster the virus spreads and the greater the total number of infections David mentioned that the incubation period of the virus is 3 e 6 days which is not accurate According to the previous analysis the disease develops on average after 6 days of incubation and it takes an average of 5 days from the morbidity to the diagnosis data from CHCC httpwwwlabourdailycn that is 5 6 11 days from the initial infection and incubation to the diagnosis and isolation after the morbidity Obviously not all 11 days are contagious Simulations show that when the average time for contagion is set to 8 days it ts the ofcial curve best 25 The simulation test of the epidemic control We know that epidemic control at different times such as closing city will have an important impact on the spread of the epidemic obviously the earlier the better Combined with the actual situation of Wuhans closure from January 23 we simulated the comparison of the spread of the epidemic situation on January 18 and January 28 as shown in Fig 5 The red curve and the orange curve in the gure respectively represent the ofcial curve and the simulation curve when the cities were closed measures were taken on January 23 Obviously the two curves match well and the simulated nal number of infected people is 69000 which is also close to the actual situation If the control is started ve days in advance that is on January 18 the blue line shows that the number of infected people is about 28000 which is 042 times of the number of conrmed cases If the measures are delayed for 5 days it can be seen from the yellow line that the number of people will be as high as 156000 about 226 times of the current number of patients Zhong Nanshans team once predicted that if the closure measures were delayed for ve days the number of patients would reach three times of the current number ie 210000 Heymann 2020 Our results are more optimistic It can be seen from this gure that it is necessary to take timely measures to control the spread of the epidemic which can also be used as a reference for some overseas countries 26 The simulation of daily new infections We also studied the curve of the daily increase in the number of people Fig 6 Because the ofcial did not include the imaging features of pneumonia in the clinical diagnosis into the diagnosis conditions for statistics before February 12 2020 the omission and inaccuracy of the previous data caused the ofcial data to jump on the February 12 the number of newly diagnosed patients in Hubei was 14840 people As shown in Fig 6 our simulation data meet the normal distribution at this time the daily new infection data peaked on February 8 with the number of 4500 However the published data due to not timely included in the clinical diagnosis image test red line many patients were not diagnosed but the curve has become a downward trend data deviation For this reason we smoothed the clinical diagnosis data on February 12 13 and 14 and used the Gauss function of latent period These three days were chosen because of the sudden increase of the number of clinical diagnosis in these three days It can be seen from the gure that the smooth number of ofcial daily infected persons black line and the simulation curve blue line t very well 3 Data analysis of nonHubei regions Due to the large liquidity before the Spring Festival in China Hubei Province has produced case output We have also conducted research on nonHubei area which is also divided into three stages the rst stage is before January 26 30 provinces and cities in the country enter the rst level of combat readiness on January 26 the second stage is from January 26 to February 5 the whole country starts to close the community in early February here we take No 5 for simulation the third stage is after February 5 A large number of simulations found that the regeneration numbers in the three stages were 38 05 and 01 respectively At this time the simulation curve blue line and the actual curve red line t well Another interesting phenomenon is that we found that if Hubei s transmission was controlled 10 days in advance Hubei began to control on January 13 its propagation curve yellow line is highly similar to the propagation curve in nonHubei regions On January 24th 235 cases were conrmed in nonHubei province with an accumulation of 1052 cases in Hubei province accounting for about 20 Finally it was ofcially announced that nonHubei 13220 and Hubei 67786 were infected which was also basically in line with the proportion of 20 In other words there is a high degree of similarity between the initial and nal transmission ratios in Hubei and nonHubei areas 290 L Li et al Infectious Disease Modelling 5 2020 282e292 4 The prediction of foreign epidemic 41 Analysis of Korea data From March 2 South Korea began to implement largescale measures to prevent and control the epidemic situation httpswwwbest73com At present the epidemic situation in South Korea is basically under control Our model simulates the actual data well and it is found through model prediction Fig 8 That South Korea will be basically controlled by the end of March We inferred from the curve and found that there was an infection in South Korea on January 7 the ofcial broadcast conrmed the diagnosis at January 20 We found that before the control the basic reproduction number of virus trans mission in Korea was 42 and the basic reproduction number after control was 01 The basic reproduction number reached 42 We suspect that some churches in South Korea ignored the spread of the epidemic in the early stage 42 Analysis of Italian data In March 13 15000 people are infected in Italy Through simulation we nd that Fig 9 if we do not control blue line at all it will grow explosively reaching 250000 at the end of March In fact Italy began to control population ow on March 8 According to the basic reproduction number 05 after Chinas city control our model predicts that by the end of March the number of conrmed cases in Italy will reach 100000 yellow line At present the basic reproduction number in Italy is 38 According to the model inversion there were infected persons in Italy on January 10 2 cases were conrmed in Italian ofcial broadcast January 29 httpstechsinacomcn The reproduction number reaches 38 which is similar to the date of the early stage in china 43 Analysis of Iranian data In March 13 11000 people are infected in Iran According to the simulation as shown in Fig 10 the infection data is expected to reach 33000 by the end of March and then it will be basically controlled by the beginning of April It was found that Iran had infection on January 11 Ofcially announced 2 cases died on February 20 no previous ofcial data https wwwhuxiucom The model found that the basic reproduction number of virus transmission in Iran before control was 38 and the basic reproduction number after control was 1 the Iranian government took many control measures in early March The basic reproduction number after control is 1 indicating that the control effect is not ideal 5 Model and description 51 Transmission of the virus Many studies have shown that virological transmission usually satises the Gaussian distribution so this article uses the Gaussian distribution to analyze the transmission of viruses Yang and Niu 2018 2019 When we use Gaussian distribution to simulate the main inuence is the average value but the standard deviation has little inuence so we will take the best accord with the objective fact variance to simulate The basic reproduction number is the number of people infected by a patient during the average illness period when all are susceptible at the morbidity of the disease The Gaussian distribution function of D1 e Nx 1 y 1 is used to represent the propagation ability of the virus This formula indicates that a single infected person can infect cid21 person on average in the rst stage At this stage cid21 has a value range of 1 and a standard deviation of y1 15 With the development of a series of effective measures the daily increase of the number of infected people also decreased to a certain extent and the transmission ability of the disease in the population decreased For the ability to spread disease through this process we still use the Gaussian distribution When a single infected person at this stage is able to infect an average of cid22 individuals the formula for the capacity to transmit is D2 e Nx2 y2 At this stage the value range of cid22 is general 0 1 cid 3 standard deviation of cid22 is y 2 2 x2 Because the medical condition of affected area and the degree of peoples activity intention directly decide the basic regeneration number in this stage The better the health care the less active the population the smaller the cid22 In the course of disease transmission the patient from being infected to the morbidity of disease we call it incubation period We assume that it takes cid23 days for people to get infected and become aware of the disease then the incubation period follows D3 eNx3 y3 In this model x 3 60 the standard deviation y3 20 In addition patients can transmit the virus to other people so we assume that the average time from infection to transmission is cid24 days which follows D4 e Nx4y4 According to the previous analysis the disease develops after an average of six days of incubation and it takes an average of ve days from morbidity to diagnosis according to NHCC that is 5 6 11 days from the initial incubation of infection to postmorbidity isolation Clearly not all 11 days are infectious and simulations show that setting the average number of infectious days to 8 best ts the ofcial curve In this model x 4 80 the standard deviation y 4 15 L Li et al Infectious Disease Modelling 5 2020 282e292 291 52 Cure the discharge process The cure time of the patient is the difference between the time of hospital discharge and the time of diagnosis set to cid25 During the epidemic period the cure time of patients was expressed by Gaussian distribution that is D5 eNx5 y 5 which means that it takes an average of cid25 days for a single individual to be cured and discharged from hospital During the early and late stages of the epidemic depending on the medical condition and level of vigilance there will be small changes to the cid25 As the epidemic continued peoples awareness of selfprotection became stronger and hospital treatment became more effective in the late stage of the outbreak the patients recovery time became shorter and shorter In Hubei Province the average time from diagnosis to cure was 21 days Relative to the spread of previous diseases the early mortality rate of this disease is also very high mainly due to the lack of understanding of the new virus and secondly the new crown virus transmission is very strong leading to the collapse of the medical system in the epidemic area Due to the continuous improvement of medical conditions and other reasons the mortality rate of the disease has continued to ease We assume that the mortality rate is cid26 then the mortality distribution follows D6 e Nx6 y6 The mortality rate will change in stages depending on medical conditions According to the CHCC Hubei Provinces current mortality rate is 45 percent In this paper through analyzing the existing data of Hubei epidemic situation the corresponding model is established and then the simulation is carried out Here we studied the main factors affecting the spread of COVID19 such as the number of basic regenerations the incubation period and the average number of days of cure What s more we predicted the evolution trend of the existing epidemic data and found that imposing controls would have important impact on the epidemic In addition according to the existing data abroad we also make bold predictions of the epidemic development trends in South Korea Italy and Iran pointing out the possible outbreaks and the corresponding control time and tracing the earliest transmission dates of countries Finally we hope that this article can make some contributions to the worlds response to this epidemic and give some references for future research Declaration of

61932005 61771071 61972051 53 Death toll 6 Conclusion Appendix A Methods A1 Data We obtained the data from the NHC of China 2020 The data information includes the cumulative conrmed cases the cumulative number of deaths newly conrmed cases and the cumulative number of cured cases for Hubei and nonHubei provinces from January 26 to March 10 We also used the data on the recent diagnoses in South Korea Iran and Italy it includes the data from the January 20 the rst conrmed diagnosis to March 13 the epidemic stabilized in South Korea the data from the January 31 the rst conrmed case to March 20 in Italy and the data from the February 20 the rst conrmed case to March 20 in Iran and here the data comes from ofcial notications from various countries A2 Parameter estimation process In different control stages the Basic reproduction number changes greatly and it affects the intensity of control directly In addition the incubation period of the virus affects the speed of transmission directly These two parameters need to be estimated Current literature shows that the uncontrolled Basic reproduction number uctuates between 28 74 Read et al 2020 Therefore we chose the valuation range in the corresponding range For the controlled Basic reproduction 292 L Li et al Infectious Disease Modelling 5 2020 282e292 number the range of valuation was selected in the range of 0 15 At the same time due to the incubation period of NHCC is given in 3 e 7 days so we put the estimates of the incubation period interval in the 3 e 9 days The average time for contagion of individuals is also an important parameter In this paper according to the data of NHCC we know that it takes 5 days from the onset to the diagnosis of isolation and the rst three days of the onset are infectious Xia et al 2020 so the average time for contagion in this paper is 3 5 8 The Monte Carlo method was used in the building stage of the model and we used the programming language C for modeling In this model a single individual may be in the following four states latency illness health or death According to the different control stages of the specic regions such as Hubei regions nonHubei regions in China Italy et al We set up different Gaussian distributions for propagation simulation By selecting the optimal estimated parameters to t the ofcial curve we use the Particle Swarm optimization algorithm to optimal the model Then we predict the future development trend based on the obtained parameter values The infection time of the initial case was reversed by the model The simu lation results are shown in Figs 1e10 References Corman V M Landt O Kaiser M et al 2020 Detection of 2019 novel coronavirus 2019 nCoV by realtime RTPCR Euro Surveillance 253 Heymann D L 20200215 Data sharing and
