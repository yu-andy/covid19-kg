detected and unfortunately the fear of novel corona virus 2019 2019 nCoV becoming a pandemic dis ease has come true Constant efforts at individual national and international level are being made in order to understand the genomics hosts modes of transmission and epidemiological link of nCoV2019 As of now whole genome sequence of the newly discovered coronavirus has already been decoded Genomic char acterization n CoV2019 have shown close homology with bat derived severe acute respiratory syndrome SARSlike coron aviruses batSLCoVZC45 and batSLCoVZXC21 Structural analysis of the receptor binding site has confirmed that 2019 n CoV binds with the same ACE 2 receptor protein as human SARS virus Compared to the previous coronavirus outbreaks the overall mortality rate is relatively low for COVID 2019 23 Suspected cases must be quarantined till their test comes positive or they clear infection At present treatment of COVID2019 is mostly based on the knowledge gained from the SARS and

infection Many other antiviral agents and vaccines are being tested but most of them are in phase I or II and hence unlikely to be of any benefit immediately with regards to current outbreak Hence the standard infection control techniques and preventive steps for healthy individuals and sup portive care for the confirmed cases is the best available strategy to deal with current viral outbreak Introduction A novel coronavirus SARSCoV2 has recently been detected December 2019 amid an outbreak of a cluster of cases of pneu monia of unknown etiology in Wuhan city Hubei province China Within next 812 weeks it has spread globally to the extent that World Health Organization WHO declared it as a global pan demic on March 11 2020 In addition to China as of 14th March 2020 this pandemic has involved more than 150 countries with a predominant disease load in Italy South Korea Iran Hong Kong Macau and Vietnam A significant number of deaths have been reported in old individuals and in patients with multiple comor bidities 1 With so much concern and attention surrounding SARSCoV2 knowledge of key clinical information and recent developments is of extreme importance both as a patient and as a health care provider Fact and figures related to COVID19 From December 2019 till today many countries worldwide have been affected by the COVID19 pandemic As of 14th March 2020 data shows 155845 confirmed COVID19 cases with 5814 deaths worldwide Currently there are 75593 active infected cases 8 5908 out of that are critically ill The early few weeks of this outbreak saw China 80824 cases as having the major bur den of the disease Very soon countries like Italy 21157 cases Iran 12729 and South Korea 8086 cases became the worsthit countries outside mainland China Figure 1 Now the number of cases is growing up even due to the 3rd and 4th generation trans missions which signifies that the disease burden is likely going to increase further in coming few weeks COVID19 fatality rate by sex Although we do not have any concrete data but as per the WHO China Joint Mission statement dated 28 February 2020 there has been a trend showing more males dying to COVID19 than females 47 vs 28 2 However this data needs to be cautiously interpreted because in China smoking behavior is more Monaldi Archives for Chest Disease 2020 901292 page 197 Noncommercial use only Review commonly seen in the males thereby having more respiratory ill nesses and complications COVID19 fatality rate by age Older individuals are especially at higher risk of dying from COVID19 as compared to younger population The fatality rate significantly worsens in the individuals of more than 60 yrs 36 as compared to individuals younger than 40 yrs 02 COVID19 fatality rate by comorbidities Patients who had no preexisting comorbidities were reported to have a low case fatality rate 09 As also commonly seen in many other illnesses preexisting medical condition increases the risk of dying due to COVID19 35 When compared with Wang et als cohort Huang et als patient population was compar atively younger median age of 49 versus 56 years and with a lower fatality rate 3 vs 43 Both studies showed hyperten sion diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disorders as the most common underlying comorbidities in COVID19 patients As per the WHOChina Joint Mission statement dated 28 February 2020 2 a risk of dying of a confirmed COVID19 patient is highest by having cardiovascular disease 132 diabetes mellitus 92 hypertension 84 and chronic respiratory disease 8 in decreasing order Basic R0 and effective reproduction number R of SARCoV2 The basic reproduction number R0 is a useful predictor that measures the transmission capability of a disease It is defined as an average number of secondary infections produced by one case in a population considering everyone is susceptible However in a prac tical world it is rare to have a population to be completely suscepti ble to a given infection due to the presence of immune individuals as well In order to successfully wipe out a disease R should go down below 1 With regards to SARSCo V2 there has been a substantial variation in reporting of transmission rates over time 67 Liu et al recently reviewed 12 studies on R0 for COVID19 and found that the major reason for the difference in reported R0 is probably due to the various estimation methods used While analyzing the results 8 They found that the studies using mathematical methods estimated a higher average R0 of 42 range 15 to 649 913 A reasonably comparable R0 was found with studies using stochastic average R0 244 range 22268 and statistical methods average R0 267 range 22 to 358 61416 Virology and epidemiology of SARSCoV2 Taxonomy In general coronaviruses are abundant in birds and mammals and constitute a big family of nonsegmented enveloped positive sense singlestranded RNA viruses 17 Amongst these bats are believed to be the home to the greatest variety of genotypes Combined animal and human coronaviruses fall into four genera namely alpha coronavirus beta coronavirus gamma coronavirus and delta coronavirus genus The Middle East respiratory syn drome MERS Severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS and SARSCo V2 all three belong to beta coronavirus genus Virus receptorbinding domainHuman ACE2 receptor interaction Atomiclevel of understanding of SARSCoV2 and its interac tion with human cells has considerably clarified the pathogenesis of COVID19 disease at a molecule are level Scientists have suc ceeded in recognizing the receptor ie ACE2 receptor for the attachment of SARSCoV2 Wan et al from the college of Veterinary Medicine Minnesota studied the complex interaction of Figure 1 Total number of cases worldwide with detailed breakdown of active and recovered cases page 198 Monaldi Archives for Chest Disease 2020 901292 Noncommercial use only Review Definitive and intermediate hosts Like the previous coronavirus outbreaks there is enough evi dence now that the virus responsible for the COVID19 pandem ic has a hidden reservoir in the wild animals and possibly there were accidental spillover to human population leading to this out break Figure 2 3031 Phylogenetic analysis and virus genome analysis with annotation have shown that coding regions of SARSCoV2 possess a similar genomic structure to batSL CoVZC45 batSLCoVZXC21 and SARSCoV 32 Paraskevis et al also did a complete genome evolutionary analysis of the SARSCoV2 and confirmed similar findings with 963 the BatCoV RaTG13 sequence sequence similarity Interestingly they also found evidence of discordant clustering in SARSCoV2 with the Bat SARSlike coronavirus sequences They concluded saying SARSCo V2 likely originated from bats but rejected the possibility of this outbreak as a result of any recent recombination event 33 Hence while the exotic animals are the definitive hosts humans and domestic animals get acci dentally exposed to wild animals during their intentional or unin tentional exposure and interaction with them to Clinical presentation Asymptomatic infections During the initial days of outbreak only the symptomatic indi viduals were thought to be infectious and capable of transmitting the infection However very soon convincing studies came up which suggested that asymptomatic individuals could potentially also be transmitting the infection Hu et al studied the clinical SARSCoV2 receptorbinding domain RBD with the ACE2 receptor Based on their structurefunction protective framework they concluded that ACE2 receptor for SARSCoV2 is the same as for the SARS virus responsible 20032004 outbreak 18 They studied various virus binding hot spots on human ACE 2 receptors and compared with orthologues isolated from other species They found that amino acids located at 442 472 479 480 and 487 posi tions enhance the viral binding capacity to the human ACE2 receptors Similarly a single mutation N501 T was found to enhance the interaction between SARSCoV2 RBD with the ACE2 receptor Data suggests that SARSCoV2 binds to human ACE 2 receptors even more efficiently than the SARSCo V2003 strain but less efficiently than the SARSCo V2002 strain Similar studies are underway with the longterm goal of understanding epi demiological link identifying the potential definite and intermedi ate hosts and predicting the speciesspecific interactions and sus ceptibility to these viral infections Incubation period According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC the mean incubation period of COVID2019 is approximate ly 51 days range 214 days Lauer et al did a pooled analysis of 181 confirmed COVID19 cases from China 19 They estimated the median incubation period of COVID19 to be 51 days The study showed that 95 of patients had incubation period ranging from 21 CI 15 to 32 to 147 CI 74 to 226 days These numbers justify the quarantine period of 14 days set by the World Health Organization WHO It is important to understand that for any com municable disease latent period and incubation period are two differ ent entities affecting the transmission dynamics Based on the discus sion by Lauer et al it is very much possible that the latency period of COVID19 may be less than its incubation period there by mean ing people may be contagious even before being symptomatic 19 Mode of transmission It is easy to understand the concept of being symptomatic and contagious to transmit a pathogen to healthy individuals in case of a communicable disease 20 However now there are recent evi dences of SARSCoV2 transmission by even minimally sympto matic or asymptomatic individuals 2122 As of now the routes of SARSCoV2 transmission seems to be diversified Major transmis sion routes are through close or direct contact with infected secre tions or large aerosol droplets 23 There is a growing concern over the possibility of the role of fecaloral transmission in COVIDcid019 transmission 2425 The obvious logic behind this speculation is the fact that ACE2 receptor protein is also found in abundance in the epithelia of intestinal lumen Also Zhang et al from Wuhan University detected the SARSCoV2 viral nucleic acids in the fecal samples and anal swabs of COVIDcid019 patients 24 The brighter side is that as compared to MERS and SARS patients with COVID 19 have reported lesser gastrointestinal symptomsdiarrhea 2cid0101 and nausea and vomiting 1 cid036 Fecaloral route is known to be responsible for many endemic diseases especially in developing countries 26 The exact significance of gutlung crosstalk and the role of gut microbiota in COVID19 is yet to be determined Hence more definitive evidence is required before we can say that targeting gut microbiota would fetch as a new therapeu tic option With regards to vertical transmission in pregnant woman from mother to baby none of the studies conducted so far on COVID19 affected pregnancies have shown any evidence of verti cal transmission viral shedding in the vaginal secretions or evi dence of SARSCo V2 in breast milk 2729 Figure 2 Epidemiological link and cross talk between wild ani mals domestic animals and humans leading to spillover of the coronavirus to humans Monaldi Archives for Chest Disease 2020 901292 page 199 Noncommercial use only Review characteristics of 24 asymptomatic individuals who were found positive for SARSCoV2 while screening for COVID19 34 At follow up only five individuals 208 developed symptoms fever cough fatigue etc 708 of individuals had CT imaging shadows twelve reported typical GGOs five reported as stripe shadowing in the lungs These results underscored the importance of close contact tracking and lengthwise reconnaissance via appro priate virus nucleic acid tests Symptomatic patients Data on clinical presentation of the SARSCoV2 outbreak is rapidly evolving The commonly reported symptoms as per the ear lier studies were predominantly related to the respiratory system like fever dry cough fatigue and myalgia 45 Nonrespiratory symp toms like nausea vomiting and diarrhea were uncommon presenta tions Unfortunately there are no pathognomonic clinical features that could confidently differentiate COVID19 from other routine viral respiratory infections 3536 The problem seems to be wors ening as we are moving away from 1st2nd generation transmissions to 3rd and 4th generation transmissions As per the study by Chen et al on 89 COVID19 patients from Wuhan the patients presenting before 23rd January 2020 had more systemic symptoms and produc tive cough as compared to the patients admitted after 23rd January 2020 37 This indicates that the pattern of symptomatology is also evolving gradually with time and hence we should be watchful for this change in symptomatology pattern so that the screening criteria can be changed if required Investigations A diagnostic test capable of rapid and accurate detection of SARSCo V2 is the need of the hour due to the enormous spread of pandemic and increasing number of COVID19 patients With regards to the United States any suspected patient should be reported immediately to appointed infectioncontrol authority at the local health center and then to the local or state health depart ment Currently in the United States CDC is the only center where the diagnostic testing can be conducted officially Once the State health department receives a call from any Medical Center it is required to immediately contact CDCs Emergency Operations Center EOC at 7704887100 who will then assist with the col lection storage and shipment of the clinical specimens Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction RTPCR As per CDC guidelines a reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction RTPCR test is the current standard of test to con firm COVID 2019 However RTPCR has also it s own challenges like i delay in result turnaround time and ii interpreting the results Another major hurdle is the dynamic conversion of RT PCR results from either negative to positive or from positive to negative Hence combining RTPCR with other investigation like computed tomography CT of the chest in an appropriate clinical setting is the best modality to investigate any patient Ai et al in their recent study suggested a higher sensitivity of CT chest 98 than RTPCR 71 in diagnosing COVID2019 38 Choosing the right specimen COVID19 disease is new for everyone and hence with each passing day more information is pouring in with regards to the diagnostic approach and selecting the best type of specimen to run the test Elucidating the diagnostic accuracy of various respiratory specimens holds a pivotal role in the control diagnosis and treat ment of COVID19 disease Specimens can be collected from the upper respiratory tract nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs lower respiratory tract sputum endotracheal aspirate broncho alveolar lavage serum and urine and stool if possible Collection samples from the lower respiratory tract usually BAL are not feasible always in every case due to logistic and medical reasons Hence BAL samples are not a routine laborato ry sample available for diagnosis and monitoring of the SARS CoV2 Instead the collection of samples from the upper respira tory tract like a nasal swab throat swab and sputum are rapid simple and safe Yang et al studied a total of 866 samples from 61 respiratory tracts of the patients including nasal swabs throat swabs sputum and 62 BAL fluid samples Amongst the upper respiratory tract samples their study showed a sputum sample having the highest positive rate 744889 followed by nasal swabs 536733 for both severe and mild cases They recom mended whenever available monitoring viral RNA titers in the BAL fluids could help in understanding the disease trajectory and prognosis 3940 Also it is important to remember that the CDC does not rec ommend any virus isolation in cell culture due to biosafety rea sons Few studies have suggested that a COVID2019 is ruled out in any case if RTPCR is negative from respiratory tract samples on two consecutive occasions which are 24 hours apart But as dis cussed above RTPCR alone can have a low detection rate 3841 Also to note that all respiratory samples should also be tested for the usual viruses such as influenza type A influenza type B aden ovirus respiratory syncytial virus and so on Computed tomography CT of chest With many limitations of RT PCR the role of imaging is increasingly recognized as a crucial step in diagnosing suspected cases of COVID19 When compared to RTPCR CT imaging seems to be feasible easily available and a rapid method A higher sensitivity rate of CT scan 97 than RT PCR 71 puts CT in a driving position with regards to COVID19 diagnosis 3841 As reported by most studies the common CT imaging findings are groundglass opacities GGOs consolidation bilateralmultilobar involvement peripheral distribution round opacities and interlob ular thickening 4542 Linear opacities crazy paving and reverse halo have been also reported as common late findings as disease progresses In contrast findings which are considered inconsistent or atypical for COVID19 infection are treeinbud opacities centrilobular distribution peribronchovascular distribu tion cavitation lymphadenopathy pleural effusion and predomi nant nodular opacities 41 Laboratory testing With regards to laboratory workup the common laboratory stud ies are complete blood count coagulation profile serum biochemi cal tests including renal and liver function creatine kinase lactate dehydrogenase and electrolytes myocardial enzymes and procal citonin The most common reported laboratory findings so far reported are normal low white cell counts elevated Creactive pro tein CRP deranged coagulogram and elevated lactic acid dehy drogenase Zhou et al reviewed 191 COVID19 patients and found that as compared to survivors the nonsurvivors had lower baseline lymphocyte count which continued to worsen until the day of death 43 Similarly nonsurvivors had higher ddimer highsensitivity cardiac troponin I serum ferritin lactate dehydrogenase and IL6 values in comparison to the survivors Similar results were also reported by Fan et al who reviewed 69 patients and found that ICU page 200 Monaldi Archives for Chest Disease 2020 901292 Noncommercial use only Review requiring patients n 9 cases were comparatively a decade older and had significant lymphopenia p0001 significant neutrophilia p 0001 significant elevated LDH p0005 and significantly lower CD45 CD3 CD4 CD19 and CD 1656 counts when compared with non ICU patients n 58 cases 44 Prevention To date no effective vaccination is available The risk of acquiring secondary and atypical infections is more so in cases of immunocompromised individuals 45 Therefore the best way in order to protect oneself is to follow the conventional infection con trol protocols and avoid unnecessary travel public transport con tact with sick people and so on Significance of hand washing The importance of frequent and proper hand hygiene should be emphasized SARSCoV2 like the other coronaviruses have a lipid envelope and in simple words washing with soap can break that fat in the envelope apart and thereby making it impossible or difficult for the virus to infect human cells Hence handwashing with soap and water is by far the more powerful weapon than any other preventive measure Also more importantly the duration of the soap wash is also equally important CDC recommends at least 20 seconds of effective engagement in hand washing In a recent study on field observations of 3749 people in a college town envi ronment Borchgrevink et al found that only about 5 of them fol lowed all the rules of handwashing and only 5 engaged them selves in an effective handwashing technique washing rubbing and rinsing for more than 15 seconds 46 This indicates that understanding of the public regarding the importance of hand washing in general is poor and hence every attempt should be made to reinforce to adopt this essential preventive measure in daytoday practice Appropriate use of face mask Physical barrier in the form of using a face mask by individu als showing respiratory symptoms is recommended by WHO Healthy individuals are not advised to use a face mask A surgical mask provides only oneway protection and prevents the spreading of droplets during sneezing and coughing from a wearer to the surrounding areas Figure 3 In contrast health care providers who are taking care of suspected or proven cases of COVID19 must wear a specialized respirator N95 which techni cally is a good fit mask preventing the entry of droplets and there by minimizing the chance of acquiring the infection Considering the high risk of transmission through direct contact stringent pre cautions should be displayed especially while handling the body secretions like urine sputum or stools of the affected patients and sewage from hospitals 47 WHO on 3rd March 2020 released a statement requesting various industries and governments to increase the production of personal protective equipment PPEs by at least 40 to meet rising global demand The shortage of PPEs is an immediate threat to the frontline health care providers endangering their life Treatment Current standard of care At present there is no specific antiviral agent that is approved for COVID19 Hence supportive care to help alleviate symptoms is the best current approach being followed by all the medical cen ters worldwide Supportive care includes isolating the patient to a negative pressure isolation room and providing adequate rest hydration nutritional support and electrolyte balance Complicated cases developing respiratory failure ARDS heart failure and sep tic shock also require a high level of care and other life support like invasive ventilation extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ECMO renal replacement therapy and so on Figure 3

Disease 2020 901292 page 201 Noncommercial use only Review Current stand of antiviral agents As mentioned above as of now there is no specific antiviral therapy for COVID19 4855 However there are antiviral agents that were found effective during the previous outbreaks of SARS and MERS Amongst the commonly used antiviral agents rib avirin interferon lopinavirritonavir have been used in the past in patients with SARS or MERS These antiviral agents are currently being used either alone or in various combinations by physicians in various medical centers worldwide to treat their COVID19 cases although the exact efficacy is still unclear Hence substan tial efforts are ongoing to find out new therapeutic agents for this coronavirus infection Hence whenever possible patients should be enrolled in ongoing randomized control trials We encourage physicians to review the latest developments and available evi dence while considering using any agent as antiSARSCoV2 medication It is also not clear till now whether a single drug ver sus a combination of multiple antiviral agents would be appropri ate to treat COVID19 cases Current stand of antibacterial agents Antibacterial agents are not to be used empirically Only in cases where a secondary bacterial infectionpneumonia is suspect ed an antibacterial agent like cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones should be used after sending blood cultures 56 Role of corticosteroids Ideally speaking the current stand of corticosteroid use in COVID19 is controversial due to the concern that it may delay the viral clearance from the body However practically speaking a judicial short term use of steroids methylprednisolone 12 mgkg body weight per day for 35 days is being used frequently by var ious health care centers worldwide for severe cases in order to ameliorate lung inflammation to prevent the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome Use of Traditional Chinese medications Traditional Chinese Medicine TCM has been used since ancient times to treat a variety of disorders across the globe 5758 Chinas National Health Commission and National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine recently recom mended using probiotics in the treatment of severe COVIDcid019 57 This could possibly maintain a balance of intestinal microe cology and prevent secondary bacterial infection However it should only be used as an ancillary add on therapy in addition to the mainline treatment strategy Newer drugs vaccines and clinical trials A coalition of researchers and scientists worldwide are work ing relentlessly with an aim to develop an ideal antiviral agent and vaccine against SARSCoV2 In general antiviral agents could belong to be a i Virusbased therapy like monoclonal antibodies or antiviral peptides targeting the various molecules steps or levels of viral machinery like viral spike glycoprotein viral enzyme inhibitors and viral nucleic acid synthesis inhibitors or ii Host based therapies to potentiate the interferon response affect host signaling pathways or host factors utilized by SARSCoV2 for replication 52 There are scientists who are also working on the concept of drug repurposing which is a strategy to generate an additional ben efit from an existing drug to target other new diseases 4849 For instance the concomitant actions of ezetimibe and statins might be useful for the treatment of several viral infections NCT00908011 NCT00099684 NCT 00843661 NCT03490097 NCT00994773 NCT00441493 On similar lines of drug repurposing Wang et al recently studied ribavirin penciclovir nitazoxanide nafamostat chloroquine and two broadspectrum antiviral drugs Remdesivir GS5734 and favipiravir T705 for their efficacy against SARS CoV2 in vitro They found that Remdesivir nitazoxanide and chloroquine were able to block SARSCoV2 infection at a low micromolar concentration 51 Remdesivir is a nucleotide analog that was originally developed during the Ebola outbreak and has shown superior antiviral activity to lopinavir LPV and Ritonavir RTV 54 Unfortunately it is not commercially available and has been used only on compassionate ground in a patient with COVID 19 in the United States 53 In contrast LPVRTV combination is widely available with a predictable toxicity profile but in a recent 18 patient series from Singapore 5 cases who were treated with LPVRTV combination had variable treatment outcomes and sig nificant toxicities of nausea vomiting diarrhea and hepatotoxicity 55 National Institutes of Health NIH has initiated a clinical trial to test Remdesivir for its clinical effectiveness at the University of Nebraska Medical Center UNMC in Omaha NCT04280705 57 Special scenarios Need of tailored approach Pregnancy and special needs Having a disease while being pregnant is a special situation as now the body has to deal with a physiological stress related to pregnancy and an additional perturbation due to pathological dis ease 2759 The treatment of COVID19 pregnant patients is more challenging than nonpregnant cases with certain additional precautions The management requires a multidisciplinary approach including obstetricgynecologists neonatologists intensivists infectious disease specialists and internists If required a CT scan of the chest should be performed as the fetal risk of radiation exposure is considered very small Secondly amongst the antiviral agents LPVRTV combination is prefer able to use considering their safety profile in pregnancy 6062 Ultrasound examination for monitoring fetal wellbeing is also recommended If a preterm delivery is anticipated an intramus cular betamethasone injection should be given to ensure fetal lung maturity There is no evidence of viral shedding through vaginal secretions or vertical transmission of SARSCoV2 Hence all patients if clinically stable should undergo vaginal delivery 2763 There are recent reports of postnatal transmis sion of the infection from diseased mother to the newborn Considering this an early cord clamping is recommended It is recommended to separate the newborn from COVID2019 infect ed mother for at least two weeks Also during this period of sep aration breastfeeding is not recommended 27 Cancer patients and their care Patients suffering from cancer are at higher risk of acquiring viral infections like SARSCoV2 infection and are likely to develop more complications 6465 Patients with hematological malignan cies patients on active chemotherapy neutropenic patients and bone marrow transplant patients are significantly at a higher risk 66 Almost all major cancer centers and oncology experts have page 202 Monaldi Archives for Chest Disease 2020 901292 Noncommercial use only Review issued their respective guidelines and statements for their practicing oncologists nurse practitioners cancer patients and their care providers In addition to following the general guidelines of personal and social etiquettes cancer patients should take a special precaution like i get a few extra refills of the essential medications ii discuss with primary oncologist before making any travel plans iii reschedule all the nonurgent appointments for the later date iv discuss with the primary oncologist about the feasibility of reschedulingpostpon ing any maintenance chemotherapyimmunotherapy in an otherwise wellcontrolled cancer in remission v ensure that oneself is up to date on a vaccination schedule Cardiovascular patients with COVID19 disease Most studies have showed patients with cardiovascular risk factors like advanced age hypertension diabetes cardiovascular diseases cerebrovascular disease had washed clinical outcome 3 A recent study including 22000 patients from Italy reported mor tality of 72 Cardiovascular risk factors in term of diabetes ischemic heart disease atrial fibrillation and a history of stroke was present in 355 30 245 and 96 simultaneously among a subset of patient with mortality Advanced age was asso ciated with higher mortality in this study with a reported case fatal ity of 128 202 in patients above age group of 70 and 80 simultaneously Across all studies cardiovascular risk factors like advanced age hypertension diabetes coronary artery disease heart failure atrial fibrillation cerebrovascular disease have been reported to be associated with increased mortality 6768 As shown in image one these factors have been independently shown to be associated with worsening disease severity bilateral conflu ent lung involvement on CT chest involvement of multiple organs requirement of invasive and noninvasive ventilation presence of cardiac injury and mortality 6971 Conclusions Our current understanding of COVID19 is limited and is still evolving COVID19 disease burden has put a lot of pressure on health resources and patient care Elimination of COVID19 is an international priority because without control of viral spread the disease burden is going to increase every day with increased mor tality Till now the best proven measures are infection control poli cies of rigorous contact tracing stringent quarantine of sympto matic contacts and hospital isolation and screening of sympto matic cases Bibliography 1 Sahu KK Mishra AK Lal A Comprehensive update on cur rent outbreak of novel coronavirus infection 2019 nCoV Ann Transl Med 2020 doi 1021037atm20200292 2 WHO Report of the WHOChina
