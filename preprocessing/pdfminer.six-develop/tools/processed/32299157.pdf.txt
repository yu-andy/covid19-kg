case in Daegu on February 18 2020 local transmission of COVID19 in the Republic of Korea has continued In this study we aimed to identify the pattern of local transmission of COVID19 using mathematical modeling and predict the epidemic size and the timing of the end of the spread Methods We modeled the COVID19 outbreak in the Republic of Korea by applying a mathematical model of transmission that factors in behavioral changes We used the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data of daily confirmed cases in the country to estimate the nationwide and DaeguGyeongbuk areaspecific transmission rates as well as behavioral change parameters using a leastsquares method Results The number of transmissions per infected patient was estimated to be about 10 times higher in the DaeguGyeongbuk area than the average of nationwide Using these estimated parameters our models predicts that about 13800 cases will occur nationwide and 11400 cases in the DaeguGyeongbuk area until midJune Conclusion We mathematically demonstrate that the relatively high percapita rate of transmission and the low rate of changes in behavior have caused a largescale transmission of COVID19 in the DaeguGyeongbuk area in the Republic of Korea Since the outbreak is expected to continue until May nonpharmaceutical interventions that can be sustained over the long term are required 23

48 In December 2019 a case of pneumonia of unknown cause occurred in Wuhan City China and was identified as a novel coronavirus infection in January 2020 Originating from Wuhan City the virus then spread to every region in China Since the report of the first confirmed case outside China in Thailand on January 13 the virus has been spreading worldwide On January 30 the World Health Organization WHO declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern 1 According to the WHO situation reports No 48 a total of 53 countries so far including the Republic of Korea Italy and Japan are showing community transmission there have been 80859 confirmed cases in China and 24727 confirmed cases outside of China as of March 8 2020 2 In the Republic of Korea after the first confirmed case of COVID19 on January 20 2020 the epidemic has continued to spread Prior to February 18 most confirmed cases were imported or a result of transmission via close contact with a confirmed patient but since February 18 local transmission has led to a spread throughout the entire nation following outbreaks in religious communities and social welfare facilities On February 23 the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention KCDC raised the infectious disease alert level to red the highest level and declared that it would implement a containment policy including patient detection and isolation along with strategies to prevent and minimize local transmission 3 The government is actively intervening by tracking and controlling those who have been in close contact and conducting disease prevention activities while the public is making efforts to prevent the transmission through social distancing and improvements in personal hygiene Figure 1 shows the infectious disease alert level and nonpharmaceutical interventions set in place by the government from February 18 to March 10 49 50 Figure 1 Timeline of COVID19 epidemic 2 Epub ahead of print 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 We applied a mathematical model that factors in the behavioral changes that were implemented in the population since local transmission began on February 18 to estimate the transmission rate The model predicts the final size and the timing of the end of the epidemic as well as the maximum number of isolated individuals While the number of confirmed cases continues to increase nationwide the number of cases in the DaeguGyeongbuk area accounts for about 90 of all cases in the Republic of Korea and the incidence rate per 100000 population in the DaeguGyeongbuk area at 13296 cases on average Daegu 23242 Gyeongbuk 4195 is at least nine times higher than the national average of 1449 as of March 10 2020 4 Our mathematical transmission model therefore discriminates between the national level and the DaeguGyeongbuk area We thus analyzed the pattern of COVID19 local transmission in the Republic of Korea by mathematical modeling and simulations and estimated the relative risk by comparing epidemiological parameters between the national level and the DaeguGyeongbuk area 65 67 Data 66 Materials and methods We used the data from the KCDC daily press releases 5 and the daily confirmed cases from February 18 when the 31st case was confirmed to March 10 The daily case data from February 18 to March 1 were updated at 900 am while from March 2 data were updated at 000 am We calculated the number of cases by region based on the initially reported cases As an estimate of the total population we used the resident registration data as of February 2020 provided by the Korean Statistical Information Service KOSIS 6 Mathematical model We constructed a mathematical model of COVID19 transmission based on the SEIR model with a hospitalquarantined group A behaviorchanged group strives to reduce the transmission rate by social distancing and other measures is also considered in this work For the behavioral changes of the susceptible group we modified the model of prevalencebased behavioral change proposed by Perra et al global prevalencebased spread of the fear of the disease to fit the situation in the Republic of Korea 7 The total population consists of susceptible 3 Epub ahead of print behaviorchanged susceptible virusexposed infectious hospitalquarantined and recovered individuals Figure 2 shows the flow diagram of COVID19 transmission according to our model Figure 2 Flow diagram of COVID19 transmission dynamics As the number of confirmed cases increases the susceptible population moves to the behavior changed susceptible group as people strive to improve personal hygiene for example by wearing a mask and practice social distancing for example by refraining from mass gatherings or meetings in awareness or fear of the spread of the virus Both the normal susceptible group that did not implement any changes in behavior as well as the behaviorchanged susceptible group can be exposed to the virus via contact with infected patients but we assumed that the probability of transmission is decreased in the behaviorchanged susceptible group Individuals who were exposed to the virus via contact with infectious patients move to the virus exposed group and develop symptoms after the virus incubation period After symptoms onset infectious individuals visit the hospital become confirmed and quarantined Finally they move to the recovered group after a recovery period In this study we assumed that individuals are hospital quarantined after a confirmation and thus can not infect others Our mathematical model of COVID19 transmission can be described with the following differential 100 101 102 equations 1 1 4 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 Epub ahead of print 103

symptom onset to confirm and isolation to 4 days 9 Period from isolation to recovery was set to 14 days which was the mean of 16 discharged patients according to the detailed information on confirmed cases reported until February 19 Mortality was not included in the present model as it was difficult to calculate the exact value at this point Table 1 shows the description and values of the parameters used in the model To define the initial value of the model we used the 31st case confirmed on February 18 as 0 To estimate the transmission rate and the rate of individuals moving from the susceptible to the behaviorchanged susceptible group we used a leastsquares fitting method that minimizes the sum of the squares of the differences between the cumulative cases data and the model curve The estimated values for all parameters for the DaeguGyeongbuk area and nationwide are presented in Table 1 Table 1 Parameter description and values Symbol Description Daegu Reference Value

The graph on the left in Figure 4 shows the number of cumulative confirmed cases over time while the graph on the right shows the number of isolated patients over time The predicted values of nationwide cases are represented by the black solid line and the DaeguGyeongbuk cases by the red dashed line 7 Epub ahead of print Figure 4 Model prediction using estimated parameters According to the model approximately 13800 cases are expected to occur nationwide and the date of the last confirmed case will be June 14 In the DaeguGyeongbuk region approximately 11400 cases are expected to occur until May 27 The proportion of DaeguGyeongbuk cases by the end of the outbreak is estimated at 8270 The number of cumulative cases per 100000 people is predicted to be 2668 nationwide and 22464 in the DaeguGyeongbuk area The number of isolated patients both nationwide and in DaeguGyeongbuk will peak on March 11 and then start to decrease The maximum number of isolated individuals predicted by the model is 4656 nationwide of which 4167 are predicted to be located in the DaeguGyeongbuk area 149 150 Table 2 Model predictions Maximum number of isolated individuals Peak of isolated individuals

February 18 2020 Assuming that the period from symptom onset to isolation is identical for the cases in the DaeguGyeongbuk area and those occurring nationwide our model estimates the percapita rate of transmission to be at least 89 times higher in the DaeguGyeongbuk area with 13616 e 7 per infected patient nationwide and 12145e 6 around DaeguGyeongbuk The transmission rate 8 140 138 139 141 142 143

185 186 187 of the behavioral changes implemented in the DaeguGyeongbuk area is also estimated to be lower than that of the national average In the early stages of the outbreak the period from symptom onset to isolation was at least 5 days but recently most patients are confirmed and isolated within 12 days of symptom onset due to the active screening of close contacts by the KCDC However as there are still reports of cases of transmission after more than 5 days from symptom onset we set the mean period from onset to isolation to 4 days in our model The rate of reduction in transmission in the behavior changed group significantly affects the model results Since the rate of reduction in transmission that results from the currently implemented social distancing policies has never been studied we factored in the number of people working at home and the delayed start of classes and concluded that the transmission rate will decrease by about 150 or more In our model a decrease in the parameter results in a decrease in the total number of confirmed cases and the duration of the outbreak In the present study we assumed that the susceptible group that implemented behavioral changes maintains a low transmission rate However when schools open again after March 24 an increase in the number of contacts and a desensitization of the behaviorchanged group with a decreasing number of patients may lead to another cluster outbreak stemming from unconfirmed positive cases Since this model assumes that patients are isolated at diagnosis and can not spread the virus further the recovery period and mortality rate do not affect the total number of patients but they only affect the calculation of the number of isolated patients and the required inpatient beds The number of daily isolated patients increases with an increasing recovery period and decreases with an increasing mortality rate 181 182 Conclusion The COVID19 pandemic is characterized by largescale cluster outbreaks in specific areas A largescale outbreak within a region beyond the capacity of local hospitals can lead to some confirmed patients having to selfquarantine during which they might infect other people It is thus necessary to predict the number of isolated patients over time through modeling to identify the number of beds required in advance and establish a response strategy 9 Epub

Contributions While in the Republic of Korea a largescale outbreak occurred in the DaeguGyeongbuk area the results of our mathematical model show that up to about 1000 confirmed cases may occur in regions outside DaeguGyeongbuk as well As part of the governments active intervention policy powerful nonpharmaceutical interventions such as postponing the start of classes in elementarymiddlehigh schools and reducing mass gatherings are being implemented However given that the outbreak is expected to continue through June it will be difficult to sustain the strengthened nonpharmaceutical interventions Therefore even after schools open again it will be necessary to suggest sustainable nonpharmaceutical intervention guidelines for example reinforcing personal hygiene practices such as mask wearing and hand washing encouraging people to avoid close contact and visit a medical center quickly after suspicious symptoms develop and shortening the time from symptom onset to isolation
