transmission Airborne infection spread Infections transmission Coronavirus COVID19 SARSCoV2 virus Hand washing and maintaining social distance are the main measures recommended by the World Health Organization WHO to avoid contracting COVID19 Unfortunately these measured do not prevent infection by inhalation of small droplets exhaled by an infected person that can travel distance of meters or tens of meters in the air and carry their viral content Science explains the mechanisms of such transport and there is evidence that this is a significant route of infection in indoor environments Despite this no countries or authorities consider airborne spread of COVID19 in their regulations to prevent infections transmission indoors It is therefore extremely important that the national authorities acknowledge the reality that the virus spreads through air and recommend that adequate control measures be implemented to prevent further spread of the SARSCoV2 virus in particularly removal of the virusladen droplets from indoor air by ventilation The entire world is anxiously watching as COVID19 a disease caused by the SARSCoV2 virus spreads from country to country following modern travel routes It was first reported to the WHO Country Office in China on 31 December 2019 httpswwwwhoint emergenciesdiseasesnovelcoronavirus2019 event sasthey happen After that it inevitably crossed the countrys boundaries and has become a global pandemic WHO 2020 b It could be said that compared with previous global epidemics or pandemics humanity is much better equipped to control the new epi demic The viruss gene sequence was identified and made public and a testing method was developed within two weeks after its existence was announced Zhu et al 2020 launching the race to develop a protective vaccine Yan et al 2020 In addition testing methods measuring the infection using RTPCR and measuring the antibodies formed after being infected using immunoassays Elfaitouri et al 2005 Souf 2016 Realtime statistics on all aspects of the viruss transmission are avail able online Worldometers 2020 Countries have enacted emergency response procedures and travel bans have been put in place Tian et al 2020 and lockdown procedures which limit the movement of people inside the administrative zones Unfortunately the truth is that we have only a rudimentary knowledge of several aspects of infection spread including on one critical aspect of the SARSCo V2 virus how THIS virus transmits Bourouiba 2020 Brosseau 2020 In general it is considered that viral respiratory infections spread by direct contact such as touching an infected person or the surfaces and fomites that the person has either touched or on which large viruscontaining droplets expired by the person have landed Morawska 2006 and there the virus can remain stable for days van Doremalen et al 2020 The droplets can also be deposited directly on a person in close proximity to the infected person Therefore frequent handwashing and maintaining a distance of at least one meter arms length are considered the main precautions against contracting the infection WHO 2020a One transmission route that is mentioned only in passing or not at all is the transport of virusladen particles in the air Immediately after droplets are expired the liquid content starts to evaporate and some droplets become so small that transport by air current affects them more than gravitation Such small droplets are free to travel in the air and carry their viral content meters and tens of meters from where they originated eg Morawska et al 2009 as graphically presented in Fig 1 Is it likely that the SARSCoV2 virus spreads by air Its predecessor SARSCoV1 did spread in the air This was reported in several studies and retrospectively explained the pathway of transmission in Hong Kongs Prince of Wales Hospital Li et al 2005 Xiao et al 2017 Yu et al 2005 as well as in health care facilities in Toronto Canada Booth et al 2005 and in aircraft Olsen et al 2003 These studies concluded that airborne transmission was the main transmission route in the indoor cases studied Other examples of airborne transmission of viral infections include the spread of Norwalklike virus between school children Marks et al 2003 and the transmission of influenza AH5N1 Corresponding author Email address

ferrets Herfst et al 2012 A World Health Organization WHO 2009 review of the evidence stated that viral infectious diseases can be transmitted across distances relevant to indoor environments by aerosols eg airborne infections and can result in large clusters of infection in a short period Considering the many similarities between the two SARS viruses and the evidence on virus transport in general it is highly likely that the SARSCoV2 virus also spreads by air Fineberg 2020 Experts in droplet dynamics and airflow in buildings agree on this Lewis 2020 Therefore all possible precautions against airborne transmission in indoor scenarios should be taken Precautions include increased ventilation rate using natural ventilation avoiding air re circulation avoiding staying in another persons direct air flow and minimizing the number of people sharing the same environment Qian et al 2018 Of significance is maximizing natural ventilation in buildings that are or can be naturally ventilation and ensuring that the ventilation rate is sufficiently high These precautions focus on indoor environment of public places where the risk of infection is greatest due to the possible buildup of the airborne viruscarrying droplets the virus likely higher stability in indoor air and a larger density of people Public places include in the first instance heath care facilities while in many hospitals care to provide adequate ventilation is a routine me a sure this is not the case in all hospital often not where new patients are admitted nursing homes etc Shops offices schools restaurants cruise ships and of course public transport is where ventilation practices should reviewed and ventilation maximized Also personal protective equipment PPE in particular masks and respirators should be re commended to be used in public places where density of people is high and ventilation potentially inadequate as they can protect against in fection others by infected individuals and being infected Huang et al 2019 Leung et al 2020 Precautions can be taken only when the national bodies responsible for the control of the outbreak acknowledge the significance of this route of transmission and recommend appropriate actions Currently this is not the case anywhere in the world In China where the outbreak started the body overseeing the prevention and control of the epidemic the National Health Commission of the Peoples Republic of China has issued a series of prevention and control guidelines As of 12 March 2020 the guidelines have been updated six times httpwwwnhc govcnjkjs35772020034856d5b0458141fa9f376853224d41d7 shtml reflecting some change in the Commissions perception of the mechanisms of the viral infection spread from no mention of airborne transmission at all to an admission of the possibility of this route of transmission However the guidelines stopped short of accepting that this is in fact happening and instead stated in the latest version 7 March 2020 that airborne transmission has not been determined In Italy which has emerged as one of the main hot spots in the world the distance of 1 m between people is recommended in indoor red zones but there is no mention of longer distance transport Gazzetta Ufficiale 2020 The list of examples could go on The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC Page last reviewed October 30 2018 takes a broader view of viral infection spread stating that Airborne transmission over longer distances such as from one patient room to another has not been documented and is thought not to occur At the time of writing the daily increase in the number of cases of COVID19 in the USA is fast WHO et al 2020 It is difficult to explain why public health authorities marginalize the significance of airborne transmission of influenza or coronaviruses but a possible reason is that it is difficult to directly detect the viruses traveling in the air Immediately after expiration the plume carrying the expired viral content is diluted and as it travels in the air carried by the air flow In the process the concentration of the virus does not increase uniformly in the interior environment of the enclosed space but it is elevated only in the flow if there is adequate ventilation which is normally the case in medical facilities or on aircraft Morawska 2006 Therefore sampling for the presence of the virus requires knowledge of the air flow from the infected person and a sufficiently long sampling period to collect enough copies of the viruses Both these requirements present major challenges microbiologists collecting viral samples are not normally experts in building flow dynamics and practicality prevents long sampling times that would be adequate for the sensitivity of existing viral detection methods Booth et al 2005 The fact that there are no simple methods for detecting the virus in the air does not mean that the viruses do not travel in the air The abovementioned retrospective modeling studies explained the trans mission of SARSCoV1 in 2003 Booth et al 2005 Li et al 2005 Olsen et al 2003 Xiao et al 2017 Yu et al 2005 While we do not yet have all the required data in hand including for example data on the patterns of infections or specific indoor characteristics where the infections occurred analysis of the initial pattern of COVID19 spread in China reveals multiple cases of noncontact transmission especially in areas outside Wuhan such as those in Hunan and Tianjin On numerous cruise ships where thousands of people onboard were infected many of the infections occurred after the imposition of isolation that confined passengers for the majority of time to their cabins and limited direct contact and with hand hygiene carefully obeyed Was it therefore the ventilation system that spread the airborne virus between the cabins one of the reasons for the infections There are also hypothesis that airborne transmission was at least partially responsible for a larger number of infections during a choir where 45 out of 60 choir members were infected Read 2020 Despite the evidence and strong hypotheses the world appears to be locked in the old way of thinking that only direct contact matters in 2 L Morawska and J Cao Environment International 139 2020 105730 viral infection spread It is disconcerting that with all the experience and evidence currently available when faced with a new viral outbreak of COVID19 the authorities still fail to acknowledge the airborne pathway of transmission although many experts in China and other countries have had experience in dealing with SARS We predict that this failure to immediately recognize and ac knowledge the importance of airborne transmission and to take ade quate actions against it will result in additional cases of infection in the coming weeks and months which would not occur if these actions were taken The air transmission issue should be taken seriously now during the course of the epidemic When the epidemic is over and retrospective data demonstrates the importance of airborne transmission it will be too late Further the lessons learnt now will prepare us better for when the next epidemic strikes To summarize based on the trend in the increase of infections and understanding the basic science of viral infection spread we strongly believe that the virus is likely to be spreading through the air If this is the case it will take at least several months for this to be confirmed by science This is valuable time lost that could be used to properly control the epidemic by the measures outlined above and prevent more infec tions and loss of life Therefore we plead that the international and national authorities acknowledge the reality that the virus spreads through air and recommend that adequate control measures as dis cussed above be implemented to prevent further spread of the SARS CoV2 virus Acknowledgments The authors would
