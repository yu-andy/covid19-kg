effective concentration 50 EC50 of 11 M and EC90 of 69 M 1 Hydroxychloroquine used in autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus has also demonstrated in vitro antiviral activity against SARSCoV2 causing coronavirus diseases 2019 COVID19 with EC50 of 072 M 2 Hydroxychloroquine was found to be more potent than chloroquine phosphate EC 50547 M 2 Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine seem to inhibit the fusion of the virus to the cell membrane by modulation of the endosomal pH 3 These drugs can also inhibit nucleic acid replication Twenty three clinical trials have been conducted in China to investigate the efficacy and safety of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of COVID19 46 Chloroquine phosphate has demonstrated marked efficacy in treatment of COVID19 with few severe adverse reactions in more than 100 patients by shortening hospital stay and improving the clinical evolution 5 These findings led to Chinese expert recommendations stating that patients with mild moderate and severe cases of COVID19 and without chloroquine contraindications should be treated with chloroquine phosphate at a dose of 500 mg twice per day for 10 days 7 Preliminary clinical data showed that hydroxychloroquine at 600 mg daily cured 70 of the patients no20 at day 6 after the first drug intake 8 Efficacy of hydroxychloroquine was improved by combination with azithromycin Azithromycin is an antibiotic with antiviral properties demonstrated against other RNAviruses such as Zika virus 910 The 6 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine associated with azithromycin 500 mg at day 1 followed by 250 mg per day the next 4 days were virologically cured at day 6 100 in comparison with patients treated with only hydroxychloroquine 571 or without treatment 125 8 These results are promising and should be supplemented by a larger number of observations Importantly therapeutic interventions using high dosage chloroquine andor in combination with macrolides may have severe sideeffects including cardiac toxicity A prophylactic approach at lower dosage could be generalized on a global scale and administrated in vulnerable persons with comorbidities atrisk of severe COVID19 Chloroquine at 100 mg daily was used for many years until 1990 for the antimalarial chemoprophylaxis of the 25 000 to 40 000 French soldiers deployed in malaria transmission areas Later chloroquine in combination with 200 mg of proguanil chlorhydrate was recommended and replaced by doxycycline in 2006 Chloroquine is usually well tolerated The more frequently reported side effects with chloroquineproguanil are epigastralgia diarrhea and nausea in longterm chimioprophylaxis in nonimmune soldiers duration 5 months 11 Combining chloroquine to antibiotic such as doxycycline in daily prophylaxis did not increase the risk of adverse effects 12 Some European countries also recommended 300 mg of chloroquine once weekly alone or in combination with proguanil 200 mg daily Some gastrointestinal side effects were observed in longterm but their prevalence were lower than that observed with chloroquineproguanil daily 13 The World Health Organization has recommended a maximum duration of 55 years in continuous use at 300 mg of chloroquine base weekly or 3 year at 100 mg daily 14 If the dose of 100 g chloroquine base is exceeded annual ophthalmological examinations are recommended Additionally chloroquine is rapidly dealkylated into antiplasmodial active desethychloroquine via cytochrome P450 enzymes Chloroquine and desethylchloroquine concentrations decline slowly with elimination halflives of 20 to 60 days 15 The promising results of chloroquine in treatment of COVID19 and the low prevalence of side effects in longterm use suggest a possible use of chloroquine at 100 mg daily or hydroxychloroquine at 300 mg weekly in mass prophylaxis in people exposed to COVID19 and could be part of urgent interventions currently required to help to protect healthcare workers combating COVID19 at the very frontline 16 Chemoprophylaxis with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine could prevent the COVID19 associated pneumonia and block the transmission by reducing the number of asymptomatic carriers We propose the use of chloroquine with a loading dose of 300 mg followed by 100 mg daily Chloroquine can be used in pregnant women in all three trimesters of pregnancy and in breastfeeding women 17 As prophylaxis chloroquine is contraindicated in patients with severe renal or hepatic diseases The prophylactic dose should be reduced in patients with mild or moderate failure to avoid drug accumulation A clinical doubleblind randomized placebocontrolled trial NCT04303507 will be initiated in may 2020 to evaluate the potential prevention of COVID19 by chloroquine at a loading dose of 10 mg base kg followed by 150 mg of chloroquine base 250 mg chloroquine phosphate salt daily for 3 months in 10 000 healthcare workers or other individuals at significant risk An average of 200 participants per site will be recruited in 50 sites The number of episodes of symptomatic COVID19 the severity of the symptoms the duration of illness the number of symptomatic respiratory infections and the number of asymptomatic infection with SARSCoV2 will be recorded and compared in the subjects randomised to chloroquine or placebo during the 5 months of followup Declarations Funding No funding Competing Interests The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare Ethical Approval Not required References 1 Wang M Cao R
