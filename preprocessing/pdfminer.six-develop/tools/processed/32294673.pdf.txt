perspective of a Tertiary Cancer Center Clinics 202075e 1864 Corresponding author Email andrechenhcfmuspbr In early December 2019 a pneumonia of unknown origin was first diagnosed in Wuhan China 1 The pathogen was identified as a novel coronavirus and was subsequently named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCo V2 2 On January 30th 2020 The World Health Organization WHO declared coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 a public health emergency of international concern 3 As of March 18th 2020 there were 212616 laboratoryconfirmed cases worldwide 4 Governments have responded in various ways to this evolving public health emergency 356 In light of the emerging data 1367 we discuss issues to be considered as health systems systematize their responses We are not trying to predict the future but rather present potential scenarios Herein we provide the perspective of the Instituto do Cncer do Estado de So Paulo ICESP Hos pital das Clnicas da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de So Paulo a publically funded tertiary referral cancer center in Brazil The current editorial does not represent institutional or governmental positions Formal policies take time to receive official approval Because of the urgent need for local regional and national preparation we write collectively as free thinkers with the best interests of society in mind and as responsible doctors that have vowed to provide the best care for our patients 8 The Spanish Influenza pandemic of 19181919 has provided us with uncontrolled populational data on the importance of social measures for mitigating the harm of epidemics Historical work 9 and mathematical modelling studies 10 suggest that early and sustained implementation of such Copyright 2020 CLINICS This is an Open Access

measures significantly reduced mortality rates during the 19181919 epidemic in the United States The SARSCoV1 20022003 epidemic has also taught us valuable lessons As stated in the WHO consensus report the experience in affected areas has shown that the trans mission can be prevented by adherence to basic public health measures including rapid case detection case isolation contact tracing and good infection control including hand washing and the use of personal protective equipment 11 Prevention and case isolation are perhaps the most critical steps to prevent any given epidemic and require active effort from authorities at all levels These nonpharmacologic interventions play an important role in mitigating a com munitywide epidemic by 1 delaying the exponential growth of the curve 2 reducing the number of cases and 3 spreading the total demand over a longer period of time to match the capacity of hospitals and other healthcare settings 10 Social institutions like churches have played an essential role in shifting the general public mindset from debauchery or indifference toward prevention Practical measures have been implemented including the prohibition of kisses and holding hands during mass 1213 and avoiding common vessels during eucharistic communion 14 Social greetings like kisses and handshaking should be avoided in any environment especially in hospitals In a recent publication the China Medical Treatment Expert Group for COVID19 reported on the epidemiology and clinical outcomes of 1099 laboratoryconfirmed COVID 19 cases 1 Severe illness occurred in 157 of the patients after admission to the hospital 50 were admitted to the ICU 23 underwent invasive mechanical ventilation and 14 died Severe disease was associated with comorbid disorders and older age Of note in patients with comorbid ities early estimates of the casefatality rate were up to 733 Data Supplement Table S3 from Guan et al 1 Only 09 of the cohort had cancer At this moment it seems too early to tell if these estimates are generalizable or even accurate but caution is warranted for patients with comorbid disorders If real mortality parameters are within the range of published data there is 1 A Tertiary Cancer Center in COVID19 Pandemic Chen ATC et al CLINICS 202075e1864 a significant risk of severe events and every effort should be taken to guarantee that suspected cases receive an adequate evaluation Complexity is added to the triage by the fact that only 438 had fever on hospital admission 1 and by extensive differential diagnoses in cancer patients such as febrile neutropenia antitumor drug side effects and other infections Regarding cancer patients followup consultations and exams from patients with no active disease or treatment could be postponed to reduce the risk of exposure Patient companions should consider going to the hospital only when necessary Attention should also be given to foodcourts and cafeterias both within and nearby the hospital given that healthcare workers and patients may share the same zone without proper protective equipment Before initiating systemic anticancer treatment physicians should weigh the evolving COVID19 epidemic risk Factors like disease severity the potential benefit from treatment drug schema immunosuppression potential patient age and comorbid conditions should be considered In the adjuvant or neoadjuvant scenarios physicians should consider the pros and cons of every available treatment option We should also consider prophylactic interventions as soon as consistent data demonstrate antiviral effects against SARSCoV2 in clinical trials for either the patients their households or health care personnel Surgery is central in cancer treatment Should there be an increase in the number of COVID19 cases in Brazil elective surgeries could be postponed There are a limited number of intensive care units ICUs with an imbalance between the public and private sectors 15 Along with Brazilian authorities efforts to improve the number of ICU beds during the COVID19 outbreak logistics need to be implemented to avoid contact between exposed and non exposed patients Nonlifethreatening surgeries could be postponed until the epidemic is under control both to avoid the risk of intercurrent COVID19 infection and to guarantee ICU beds to critical patients In cases with neoadjuvant treatment the interval to surgery needs to be entered into the equation It is estimated that 10 of patients affected by COVID19 need prolonged admission in ICUs This empha sizes the importance of nonpharmacologic community strate gies to reduce incidence and lessen the need for healthcare services 10 that In any given epidemic realtime quality data is essential for critical decisionmaking The Brazilian Health Ministry is to be commended for implementing a REDCap online form for notification of suspected cases 16 Additional efforts are needed in systems integration so that relevant information is available for healthcare workers and other stakeholders the Brazilian Health Ministry consider We suggest WHO recommendations 17 and lead the implementation of standard online forms to collect sensitive data on clinical characteristics treatment and outcomes laws to fight Of note Brazils legislative bodies are to be commended for the fast approval of the COVID19 international public health emergency The Federal Council of Medicine Conselho Federal de Medicina and Ethics Committees are to interpret the new law and clarify if consent forms to diagnose and treat COVID19 patients can be waived 18 Should consent be needed we suggest verbal consent as a means to prevent pen and paper consent forms from becoming a transmission route as we have seen in the Diamond Princess situation 19 At this point it is appropriate to comment on the fear that excessive data may lead to panic among the general public We partially agree with this statement though we also stress that sensitive data need to be readily available to healthcare providers and decisionmakers in order to mitigate this epidemic Misinformation erodes public trust and may result in backlash 20 As the number of new cases accrue in Brazil physicians and healthcare workers on the frontline should have their nonclinical workload reduced to a minimum to focus on adequate contact precautions and patient care Healthcare to providers should reallocate administrative personnel perform nonclinical tasks including paperworkfilling and data collection as much as possible Hospitals should take their time to train staff to effectively implement contact precautions and flow processes Adequate emotional support for staff and reasonable hours of risk exposure are also sug gested to prevent burnout as health professionals struggle to care for patients and protect their lives and families We hope this editorial may foster discussion among the authorities and healthcare stakeholders and help to plan and implement pathways to minimize the impact of the COVID 19 epidemic AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS Chen ATC was responsible for the study main idea and conception data acquisition analysis and interpretation manuscript drafting and
