swab is the reference sampling method to detect SARS CoV2 as 52 recommended by world Health Organization WHO 1 However the collection of nasal 53 specimens may have a slightly lower sensitivity than nasopharyngeal specimens 2 3 We 54 herein validated an alternative procedure to collect nasal secretions with swab routinely used 55 in medical bacteriology for which there is no risk of supply disruption in order to perform the 56 molecular diagnosis of SARSCoV2 infection 57 Patients who were suspected of COVID19 attending the Hpital Europen Georges 58 Pompidou Paris France were for their own care according to medical decision prospectively 59 included and subjected to SARSCoV2 molecular testing using nasopharyngeal swab Xpert 60 Nasopharyngeal Sample Collection Kit Cepheid Sunnyvale CA USA and nasal swab 61 Copan Transystem Copan Brescia Italy 62 Nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs were inserted in the nostril until they hit an obstacle 63 the inferior concha and the back of the nasopharyngeal cavity respectively rotated 5 times 64 and removed The test was conducted in only one nostril per patient After sampling 65 nasopharyngeal swab was inserted into a vial containing 3 m L of virus transport medium 66 Xpert Viral Transport medium Cepheid and nasal swab was placed in a 15 m L tube 67 containing 3 m L of saline solution NaCl 09 SARS CoV2 was detected using Allplex 68 2019 n CoV Assay Seegene Seoul Korea 69 A total of 44 patients were prospectively included up to the end of March 2020 Their 70 median age was 630 years ranging from 18 to 94 years There were 23 523 male and 21 71 female patients A total of 37 841 patients showed laboratoryconfirmed SARSCoV2 72 infection using nasopharyngeal swab 7 remaining negative 159 Table 1 73 Out of 37 patients that were positive for SARSCoV2 by nasopharyngeal swab 74 testing 33 were also tested positive with nasal sampling All SARSCoV2negative patients 75 with nasopharyngeal swabs n 7 tested negative using nasal swabs Table 1 76 l D o w n o a d e d f r o m h t t p j c m a s m o r g o n A p r i l 1 8 2 0 2 0 b y g u e s t 3 By reference to nasopharyngeal sampling the detection of SARSCoV2 by nasal 77 sampling provided 7 159 true SARSCoV2negative specimens 4 91 false negative 78 specimens and 33 750 true SARSCoV2positive specimens Thus the sensitivity of 79 SARSCo V2 RNA detection by multiplex realtime PCR from nasal secretions was 892 80 95 confidence interval CI 753957 and it s specificity was 1000 95 CI 94681 1000 The index was 072 indicating substantial concordance between nasal and 82 nasopharyngeal swabbing to detect SARSCoV2 according the Landlis and Kochs rank The 83 Youdens J index was calculated at 892 demonstrating good efficiency to detect SARS84 CoV2 RNA 85 Ct mean SD values for E Rd RP and N genes by nasopharyngeal E 23949 86 RdRP 26355 N 28961 and nasal E 22352 RdRP 24659 N 27961 swabs 87 testing were of similar levels Differences in Ct values for the E RdRP and N genes were not 88 statistically significant p 056 084 and 057 respectively 89 We herein report that the molecular detection of SARSCoV2 using nasal swab 90 specimens was nearly equivalent to the detection using nasopharyngeal swab considered as 91 the gold standard SARSCoV2 detection from nasal samples showed high sensitivity and 92 specificity Agreement and accuracy of test results using nasal sampling by reference to gold 93 standard nasopharyngeal sampling were estimated as substantial and good respectively 94 Taken together these observations demonstrate that nasal sampling could be used to screen 95 SARSCoV2 in times of nasopharyngeal swab shortage 96 97 98 l D o w n o a d e d f r o m h t t p j c m a s m o r g o n A p r i l 1 8 2 0 2 0 b y g u e s t 4 Acknowledgments We thank
