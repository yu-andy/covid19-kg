Organization There is an emergent need to search for possible medications Method Utilization of the available sequence information homology modeling and in slico docking a number of available medications might prove to be effective in inhibiting the COVID 19 two main drug targets the spike glycoprotein and the 3 CL protease Results Several compounds were determined from the in silico docking models that might prove to be effective inhibitor for the COVID19 Several antiviral medications Zanamivir Indinavir Saquinavir and Remdesivir show potential as and 3 CLPRO main proteinase inhibitors and as a treatment of COVID19 Conclusion Zanamivir Indinavir Saquinavir and Remdesivir are among the exciting hits on the 3 CLPRO main proteinase It is also exciting to uncover that Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide FAD Adeflavin B2 Deficiency medicine and Coenzyme A a coenzyme may also be potentially used for the treatment of SARSCoV2 infections The use of these offlabel medications may be beneficial in the treatment of the COVID19 Keywords SARSCoV2 Coronavirus molecular docking approved drugs medications Introduction The World Health Organization has now declared a global emergency and pandemic for the coronavirus disease COVID19 that has been actively spreading around the globe COVID 19 which is caused by the virus SARSCoV2 can cause symptoms such as fever cough 2 pneumonia nausea and fatigue As of now SARSCoV2 has reached 24 countries around the globe with more than 190000 cases confirmed as of March 18 2020 Organization 2020 The epidemiological background of the virus was thought to stem from a seafood market in Wuhan China Chen et al However the true epicenter of the initial transfer to humans is still unknown Currently there are 100 complete genome sequences known in the NCBI GenBank from over 10 countries The variation between these sequences is less than 1 This virus is closely related to the SARS CoV and this allows utilization of the known protein structures to quickly build a model for drug discovery on this new SARSCo V2 Hui et al 2020 While traditional methods of drug discovery could take years the approach taken here to search for possible medications for the SARSCOV2 is in silico docking models from the most variable proteins in the SARSCoV2 the spike glycoprotein and the SARSCoV2 3CL main protease The CoV spike protein binds to a host cells membrane through a receptor mediated interaction which allows entrance to the host cell It has been computationally determined that the SARSCoV2 has similar mechanism to that of the SARS virus and the receptor to which it has the highest affinity is ACE2 angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 Xu et al While there are structural similarities between the SARSCoV2 spike protein and the SARS spike protein the conservation is only 73 with most of the variability being in the host cell interaction region of the protein Currently there is no crystal structure available for the SARSCo V2 spike protein so we employed homology modeling of the SARSCoV2 utilizing the SARS spike protein PDB 2 GHV as a template The second in silico docking model is the 3CLPRO main protease which is responsible for controlling several major functions of the virus and has a highly conserved catalytic domain from 3 the SARS virus Anand et al 2003 Some of its functions include the replication processes of the virus which makes it an ideal target for drug development Bacha et al 2004 The SARS CoV2 main protease was determined by Liu X et al PDB 6LU7 Liu Both these proteins spike and protease are essential to the transmission and virulence of the virus By inhibiting anyone of these two proteins or both for a higher active therapy the severity of the infection will be reduced Our efforts have been placed in competitively inhibiting the binding of its natural substrates A library of known bioactive compounds has been run against several sites on the spike protein and the catalytic site of the SARSCoV2 main protease By utilizing an approved compound database quick trials of these compounds with minimal effort of approval by food and drug agencies could be carried out We have chosen to run the Zinc15 database which is classified by Zinc15 Sterling and Irwin 2015 as Approved drugs in major jurisdictions including the FDA ie DrugBank approved This database covers all major bioactive pharmaceutical compounds utilized around the globe and currently has 3447 entries Methods Molecular Docking Molecular docking calculations were completed using Schrodinger docking suits Schrdinger Maestro New York NY USA Version 119011 MMshare Version 45011 Release 20191 Platform Windows x 64 using a virtual screening workflow This workflow utilized three docking precisions HTVS SP and XP which yielded the top 10 of hits for each binding site Both proteins were prepared by restrained minimization using force field OPLS3 e The grid sites were created using Glide receptor grid generator with docking length of 20 4 Grids centers were determined from active resides on target protein Ligands were prepared using force field OPLS3e and possible states were generated from p H 70 20 Docking scores are reported kcalmol the more negative the number the better binding Homology Modeling of Spike Protein The surface glycoprotein Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus Sequence ID YP0097243901 structure was modeled using ModBasePieper et al 2014 which utilized ModellerEswar et al 2008 for the structural modeling The sequence NCBI Accession YP009724390 was uploaded to the ModBase interface and was run with the template being SARS spike protein receptor binding domain PDB 2GHV Chain E The sequence identity was found to be 73 Figure 1 A The calculation was completed and imported into Schrdinger Maestro The structure was then minimized using the force field OPLS3e the overlay of the pre and post minimized structure can be seen in Figure S2 Results Spike Glycoprotein Sequencing has revealed that the SARSCoV2 is similar to that of the SARSCoV virus which allows for genomic and proteomic homology comparison Using the homology modeling we have been able to develop a model of the Spike glycoprotein Figure 1 This model has allowed us to perform docking calculations utilizing a database of known bioactive and approved compounds 5 A B Figure 1 A Modeled SARSCoV2 Spike Glycoprotein overlaid with the SARSCoV PDB 2 GHV unique amino acids are shown Variable amino acid residue side chains are shown Green SARSCoV Red SARSCoV2 B Minimized final structure of modeled SARSCoV2 spike glycoprotein The MODELLER and ModBase programs were able to use a homologues SARS spike protein PDB 2 GHV and the original SARSCoV2 sequence GenBank MN908947 and construct the SARSCoV2 spike protein Protein was then run through a restriction minimization process utilizing Schrodinger Docking Suits Protein Preparation which allows side chains to be placed in the most energetically favorable conformation Figure 1B In an effort to stop the SpikeACE2 interaction several sites have been determined and targeted on the Spike protein for docking studies Three of these sites are located at the interaction points specifically where hydrogen bonding is calculated as the main intermolecular force of the SpikeACE2 interaction and a fourth allosteric site has been determined by surface mapping of the protein 6 The locations of the binding sites have been chosen as these would cause the most destruction in ACE2 interactions The sites are labeled as site 14 and information on the sties can be seen in Supplemental Table S1 Figure

minimization process utilizing Schrodinger Docking Suits figure S3A Previous studies have revealed in the SARS protease mutation of the residue His 162 renders the enzyme inactive The SARSCoV2 homologous residue is His 163 Site 1 center x 1759 y 1581 z 6353 figure S3B which has been used as the central point for molecular docking calculations The active site also revealed a second Histidine
