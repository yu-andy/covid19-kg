disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 has reached pandemic status As it spreads across the world it has overwhelmed healthcare systems strangled the global economy and led to a devastating loss of life In the ongoing wake of COVID19 the worlds medical and scientific communities have come together to rapidly expand our knowledge of the pathogenesis disease manifestations and possible preventive and therapeutic strategies Virologists have looked to related diseases to understand the life cycle of this novel viral infection Despite being overwhelmed through conventional and historically unconventional mechanisms clinicians managing patients with COVID19 have made a concerted effort to rapidly educate colleagues in expectant regions of the world on lessons learned The worlds regulatory agencies and pharmaceutical industry are using emergency mechanisms to expedite access to and study of therapeutic options These widespread efforts drawn from many arenas are driving a rapid expansion of collective experience and understanding of COVID19 Here we review this body of work with a focus on our basic understanding of the mechanisms of disease and translation to the clinical syndrome and potential therapeutic options Specifically we discuss the basic virology epidemiology and clinical manifestations including presentation progression multiorgan consequences and outcomes With a focus on the cardiovascular complications we propose several potential mechanisms of injury We discuss a range of possible therapeutic options in the context of the viral life cycle and possible mechanisms of injury Finally in recognition of the scale of this crisis we address the ethical considerations around standards of care in the event of resource scarcity 3 Basic Virology of SARSCoV2 Genetics and Structure Coronaviridae comprise a family of enveloped single stranded positive sense RNA viruses with comparable genomic organization and functional mechanisms Coronaviruses CoV are canonically divided into alpha and beta gamma and delta genera predicated on genetic clustering The alpha and bet aCoV are known to cause human diseases such as common respiratory infections The SARSCoV2 and SARSCoV1 are bet aCoV 13 CoV are so named because of the characteristic crown or corona of electron density that they exhibit on transmission electron micrographs This appearance is thought to be caused by the densely packed protein that studs the viral membrane and is responsible for receptor binding on target cell membranes The CoV genome is organized into two parts Highly conserved with the CoV family the 5 terminal end encodes the replicase the nonstructural proteins responsible for viral replication within the cell 13 It is translated as one peptide 790 k Da from which the constituent functional proteins are subsequently cleaved CoV genomes encode 16 nonstructural proteins as in SARSCoV2 and they exhibit a multitude of functions required for viral replication 245 Critical proteins for viral replication include the main protease nsp5 the papainlike protease nsp 3 and the RNAdependent RNA polymerase nsp 12 RdRp The other replicase constituent proteins repurpose the cellular machinery to facilitate viral replication and to blunt the intrinsic host immune functions 16 4 The remaining third of the CoV genome encodes the structural proteins and a variety of accessory proteins latter not discussed here The structural proteins are the constituent proteins of the transmissible viral particle or virion The key structural CoV proteins are the nucleocapsid protein N and three transmembrane proteins the spike protein S the membrane protein M and the envelope protein E 15 Figure 1 The S protein is responsible for viruscell receptor interactions 711 Figure 1 The E and M proteins are responsible for membrane structure and fusion The N protein binds viral RNA and mediates its interaction with the S E and M proteins for genome encapsulation 112 Life Cycle The life cycle of SARSCoV2 has not been rigorously established however given the considerable sequence homology it is presumed to be similar to that of SARSCoV1 and other CoV 45 In general the CoV life cycle consists of a series of steps that begins with viral binding to a target cell and culminates in viral reproduction Knowledge of this process informs an understanding of viral physiology and also will serve as the basis for discussion of antiviral therapeutics 8 Figure 1 The aim of evolving therapeutics will be to break the links in the chain of the viral life cycle in order to forestall the propagation of infection within the cells of an individual patient SARSCoV2 is known to bind to cells via the same receptor as SARSC oV1 the membrane bound glycoprotein Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 ACE2 4 It has not been observed to bind other CoV receptors namely dipeptidyl peptidase 4 DPP4 or aminopeptidase N APN 413 After binding of ACE2 the virus is internalized via endocytosis without access to the 5 host intracellular compartment until a membrane fusion event occurs 4 Figure 1 This process is mediated at least in part by another membrane bound protease known as transmembrane serine protease 2 TMPRSS2 which cleaves the S protein as a necessary step of membrane fusion 7 Interestingly the protease activity of the CoV receptors ACE2 DPP4 and APN does not seem necessary for membrane fusion 14 Upon membrane fusion the viral RNA genome enters the intracellular compartment At this point the viral RNA may be translated into its encoded structural and nonstructural proteins The translation of the nonstructural proteins or replicase results in the production of a single massive polypeptide chain from which the sixteen constituent nonstructural proteins are cleaved This process is initially mediated by intracellular proteases and then further propagated by the function of the CoV main protease and papainlike protease 1 Another replicase protein the RNAdependent RNA polymerase RdRp is responsible for the replication and amplification of the viral genome 15 During this process mutations may be acquired by errors in replication and recombination events 1 Upon amplification of the viral RNA more viral structural and nonstructural proteins may be generated Viral structural proteins because of their transmembrane nature with the exception of the N protein are targeted to the ER membrane with appropriate signal sequences Viral RNA bound by N protein interacts with the structural proteins on the membrane of the ER and Golgi apparatus before another membrane fusion event on these membranes results in viral budding and exocytosis 1812 6 Importantly the precise molecular differences that account for the important clinical differences between SARSCoV2 and SARSCoV1 infections such as prolonged latency widely variable symptoms a possible predisposition for individuals with preexisting cardiovascular conditions and a predilection for myocardial complications remain unclear Pathogenesis AngiotensinConverting Enzyme 2 SARSCoV2 SARSCoV and HCoVNL63 a virus that causes a mild respiratory infection are all known to employ ACE2 as a receptor 341617 Given the functions of ACE2 in the cardiovascular system the importance of angiotensindirected pharmacology in cardiovascular disease and the apparent propensity for severe illness among patients with COVID19 with cardiovascular comorbidity the ACE2 molecule has been the subject of much attention 18 Indeed major clinical societies have issued consensus statements on the use of ACE inhibitors ACEi and angiotensinreceptor blockers ARBs in the setting of the COVID19 pandemic as discussed later 19 AngiotensinConverting enzyme 2 ACE2 is a singlepass transmembrane protein with protease activity that cleaves the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II into the vasodilator angiotensin 17 20 23 In doing so it functions as a counterregulatory enzyme to the functions of ACE1 which generates angiotensin II 20 In humans the protein has a broad pattern of expression and has been found in the lung epithelium in particular the type II pneumocyte the myocardium the endothelium the GI tract bone marrow kidneys and spleen among other tissues potentially explaining the multiorgan injury observed with SARSCoV2 infection 24 Another relevant 7 feature of Ace2 gene expression is it s encoding on the X chromosome which may account for possible sex differences observed in the epidemiology of COVID19 25 In animal models of acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS due to chemical pneumonitis overwhelming sepsis endotoxemia or influenza Ace 2KO mice have more severe acute lung injury ALI relative to their wildtype counterparts as evaluated histologically and by measures of elastance 2628 The phenotype of increased elastance was rescued by administration of recombinant human ACE2 which affirms a causal link between Ace2 deficiency and a more profound state of ALI 2628 Additionally the administration of losartan an angiotensin II type1 receptor AT1R blocker mitigated the exacerbating effects of SARSCoV spike protein in an animal model of ARDS 29 Losartan also abrogated the severity of ALI due to influenza in mice 2728 In regard to the counterregulatory properties of ACE1 and ACE2 the effects of Ace2 deficiency appear to be rescued by Ace1 deficiency in mice For example the effects of Ace2 deficiency to result in more severe ALI are abrogated by Ace1deficiency Ace2KO mice demonstrated more severe ALI than Ace2KOAce1 with further reduction in severity observed in Ace2KOAce1 26 This doseresponsiveness also implies causation Comparable effects were seen with myocardial dysfunction as Ace2KOAce1 and Ace2KOAce1 had no evidence of the contractile deficit observed in Ace2 KO mice 30 Of note in each of the above cases however the animal models were constitutive knockout systems rather than lineagespecific or inducible knockout Thus the ACE2 expressing cell that mediates each phenotypic abnormality has not been determined 8 SARSCoV2 is able to utilize ACE2 isoforms from swine bats civets and humans suggesting a mechanism whereby the virus may have been initially transmissible from species to species and with mutation evolved into a novel pathogen 4 Notably murine ACE2 is not a functional receptor for SARSCoV2 thereby requiring transgenic expression of human ACE2 if mice are to be used as a research model 4 ACE2 undergoes cleavage by the membranebound protease ADAM17 resulting in the release of soluble ACE2 into the blood stream 31 The effects of soluble ACE2 are unclear in humans however it appears to have favorable effects on lung function in models of ARDS influenza and RSV infection 262832 Soluble ACE2 has been studied in a phase II trial of ARDS but large scale wellpowered clinical outcomes trials are needed 33 Research is ongoing to determine whether soluble ACE2 may act as a specific therapeutic to SARSCoV2 in the role of a decoy receptor as discussed later 34 Finally given the necessity of ACE2 for viral infection the role of ACE inhibitors ACEi or angiotensin receptor blockers ARBs in COVID19 has drawn intense attention Importantly the ACE2 enzyme itself is not inhibited by ACEi ARB use 21 ACEi or ARB exposure may result in ACE2 protein upregulation in animal models however not all animal models exhibit this effect The existing epidemiology of COVID19 among patients taking ACEi or ARB is confounded by cardiovascular comorbidities which may alter ACE2 and angiotensin II expression 18 At this time it is unclear if ACEi or ARBs use influences receptor expression and whether variable expression impacts the propensity for or severity of SARSCoV2 infection 9 Transmission Exposure to the Huanan seafood market was common among the earliest cases contributing to the SARSCoV2 epidemic in China suggesting that this was a zoonotic disease with an intermediate animal host nonaquatic animals were sold in the market 35 Genomic analyses have identified approximately 87 DNA sequence homology between SARSCoV2 and two SARSlike CoV isolated from Chinese horseshoe bats batSLCoVZC45 and batSL CoVZXC21 in the Zhejiang province in China 36 Notably no bats are sold in the market and at the onset of the outbreak in December most bat species in Wuhan would be hibernating Thus similar to SARSCoV1 and MERSCoV while bats may be the natural reservoir for SARS CoV2 there is likely an unidentified intermediate animal host responsible for animaltohuman transmission Despite closure of the Huanan market on January 1 2020 the epidemic continued to expand and case clusters with no exposure to the market were reported indicating the occurrence of humantohuman transmission 37 Akin to other respiratory viruses SARSCoV2 spreads primarily through small respiratory droplets that are expelled from infected individuals and can travel approximately 36 feet The virus can exist in nature on surfaces and can last for up to 4 hours on copper 24 hours on cardboard and up to 72 hours on plastic and stainless steel surfaces leading to fomite transmission 38 In fact the Japanese National Institute of Infectious Disease reported detection of SARSCoV2 RNA on surfaces in the cabins of symptomatic and asymptomatic passengers on the Diamond Princess up to 17 days after they were vacated 39 Live virus has also been isolated and cultured from fecal specimens raising the possibility of orofecal transmission 10 though corroborating clinical evidence for this method of transmission is lacking 40 Airborne transmission may be facilitated in healthcare settings where aerosolproducing interventions are being performed including endotracheal intubation bronchoscopy suctioning nebulizer treatment noninvasive positive pressure ventilation and delivery of oxygen via a highflow nasal cannula These transmission data support the clinical recommendations that airborne precautions including use of N95 masks should be implemented in these aerosolproducing settings whereas standard droplet precautions should be used during all other encounters with infected individuals 41 In a fully susceptible population reflected by early stages of the epidemic in China studies have estimated a basic reproductive number Ro of 238 for SARSCoV2 meaning that every infected individual is likely on average to spread the virus to 2 to 3 other individuals 42 An outbreak will continue to increase in size if the Ro1 For context seasonal influenza has an Ro of 15 43 Substantial transmission from asymptomatic hosts has facilitated the widespread transmission of SARSCoV2 and contributed to its pandemic potential 42 A study from Singapore with extensive contact tracing identified 7 clusters of cases where secondary spread of the infection occurred 13 days prior to symptom development in the source patient 44 Thus containment measures aimed solely at isolating symptomatic individuals are inadequate Furthermore contact tracing efforts should take in to account the presymptomatic contagious period to comprehensively capture all potentially exposed individuals Ro is not a static measure and interventions including selfquarantine contact isolation social distancing and enhanced hygiene measures have proven to be effective in China Following implementation of such measures in 11 China the Ro steadily decreased from 238 prior to January 23rd to 099 during the period of January 24 February 8 2020 42 Epidemiology and Clinical Manifestations of SARSCoV2 Epidemiology The burden of the SARSCoV2 virus has evolved rapidly since it first appeared in Wuhan China in December 2019 What began as a few case reports of atypical pneumonia now spans the globe as a pandemic At present most published data come from China and form the basis for our understanding of the epidemiology of COVID19 In the largest published registry to date the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC reported highlevel details for patient characteristics severity of manifestations and survival in 72314 cases of putative 47 and confirmed 63 COVID19 45 In this population predominantly identified by the presence of symptoms 99 2 of cases occurred in children 19 years of age suggesting that children either are either resistant to infection or rarely symptomatic Of confirmed cases most 87 were mild defined by no or mild pneumonia 14 were severe with significant infiltrates or signs of respiratory compromise and 5 were critical with respiratory failure eg mechanical ventilation shock or multiorgan system failure The first confirmed case of COVID19 in the US was identified on January 20 2020 and the US has now surpassed all other countries in the absolute number of cases However given the rapid and recent onset of the burden there are few published data reflecting the experience with COVID19 in the US In an early snap shot from the US CDC in 4226 confirmed cases with symptoms or exposure only 5 occurred in those under the age of 20 46 12 While data are rapidly accumulating much of the epidemiology of this virus remains unknown Most publications are small single center studies and detail the clinical characteristics complications and outcomes in the subset of patients who were hospitalized As a result of the limitations on testing and the data suggesting that many infected individuals may be asymptomatic the true burden of infected individuals is unclear and underestimated 4247 Not only does the variable manifestation of symptoms hamper public health initiatives to trace and isolate infected individuals but also it limits our ability to accurately estimate infectivity symptom burden and nonfatal and fatal complication rates in the overall population of infected individuals With that caveat the published data provide insights into the more vulnerable at risk populations who require hospitalization While the individual studies are small the predictors of more severe manifestations and poor outcomes have been generally consistent as detailed below Clinical Presentation Syndrome In a multicenter case series of 1099 hospitalized patients from China the most common symptoms were fever in up to 90 followed by cough fatigue sputum production and shortness of breath 48 Less common symptoms included headache myalgias sore throat nausea vomiting and diarrhea The American Association of Otolaryngology has recently highlighted anosmia and dysgeusia as possible symptoms of disease as well 49 The median incubation period or time from probable exposure to first symptom was 4 days IQR 27 48 Another report detailed that 99 of infected patients develop symptoms within 14 days 50 Common lab derangements on admission included lymphopenia elevations in creactive protein 13 lactate dehydrogenase liver transaminases and ddimer 48 Notably procalcitonin was rarely elevated 48 These data are generally consistent across multiple smaller studies several of which noted elevations in other inflammatory markers such as IL6 ferritin and ESR 5155 Evidence of cardiac or kidney injury at admission was variable across studies but tended to be absent upon hospitalization 48515356 Chest computed tomography at the time of admission was abnormal in 87 of patients with ground glass opacities or local or patchy shadowing 48 Disease Progression Many of the more severe manifestations such as ARDS acute kidney injury AKI and myocardial injury tend to occur as many as 814 days after the onset of symptoms and portend worse outcomes 53 Within a hospitalized population rates of ICU admission range between 2632 across most studies 3548515357 Several studies have identified older age and baseline burden of comorbidity such as diabetes hypertension prior coronary disease and prior lung disease as predictors of more significant disease progression with higher rates of ARDS AKI cardiac injury ICU admission and death 51535859 Increases in markers of inflammation coagulation and cardiac injury also correlate with disease severity and rise throughout the course of the disease 535456 In hospitalized populations the timing of death occurred at a median of 1619 days after illness onset 5358 The median time from symptom onset to discharge in survivors was around 3 weeks 53 NonCardiovascular Clinical Manifestations Respiratory Failure 14 The most prominent complication of COVID19 is respiratory failure As previously described the majority of patients have no or mild symptoms 45 In hospitalized patients respiratory symptoms are common and range in severity from cough 6080 or dyspnea 1940 to ARDS 1742 51535657 ARDS rates were only 32 in the largest case series but this may be an underestimate due to a short average follow up time of 12 days with the vast majority of patients remaining hospitalized at the end of study 48 ARDS tends to occur 12 weeks into illness and is often precipitous and protracted 515357 For these reasons and to avoid risk of provider infection with emergent intubation professional societies recommend early intubation in the event of respiratory decline 41 Intubation was required in 1033 in the various Chinese series however rates of highflow nasal cannula and noninvasive mechanical ventilation also were high 355153 These therapies are believed to result in aerosolization and are generally not recommended consequently more patients will be intubated when unable to be supported by nasal cannula or a nonrebreather mask 41 Older age baseline hypertension diabetes high fever lymphopenia injury to other organs eg AKI ALI and elevated ddimer and inflammatory markers were predictors of ARDS advanced age neutropenia elevated ddimer and inflammation are associated with higher mortality in those with ARDS 51 Development of ARDS along with acute cardiac injury was an independent predictor of death 56 Importantly hypoxemic respiratory failure is the leading cause of death in COVID19 contributing to 60 of deaths 58 Renal injury Estimates vary as to the incidence of acute kidney injury in COVID19 ranging between 05 15 354852535659 Among hospitalized patients the rates of proteinuria 439 and 15 hematuria 267 appear to be even higher 59 Acute kidney injury occurs in the first few days after admission in patients with baseline chronic kidney disease and after 710 days in patients with normal baseline renal function 59 Mechanisms of renal injury have been hypothesized to include both acute tubular necrosis ATN direct cytotoxic effects of the virus itself and immunemediated damage 59 Liver injury Transaminitis is common with an incidence of 2137 and as high as 4862 of patients who are critically ill or who do not survive 354853 Acute liver injury defined as either alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase greater than three times the upper limit of normal occurs less frequently and was reported to occur in 191 n 4 of 21 patients who were admitted to an ICU in Washington State 55 Cardiovascular Manifestations Cardiac injury Numerous studies have reported acute cardiac injury as an important manifestation of COVID 19 In studies published to date acute cardiac injury was variably defined as either cardiac troponin elevation 99th percentile alone or a composite of troponin elevation ECG or echocardiographic abnormalities 525658 Importantly many aspects of this endpoint remain undefined including the frequency and severity of associated structural abnormalities The reported rate of cardiac injury varies between studies from 7 to 28 of hospitalized patients a number which is likely partially dependent upon the definition used and the severity of cases at the hospital from which the data was drawn 525456 Notably patients with evidence of 16 cardiac injury tend to be older with more comorbidities including baseline hypertension diabetes coronary heart disease and heart failure 5456 Across all studies cardiac injury is associated with worse outcomes including ICU admission and death 525456 Based on serial assessment of troponin researchers in China reported that the median time to the development of acute cardiac injury was 15 days IQR 10 17 after illness onset occurring after the development of ARDS 53 Of note early cardiac injury has been reported even in the absence of respiratory symptoms 60 In a case series by Shi et al the mortality rate for those hospitalized with subsequent evidence of cardiac injury was significantly higher than those without cardiac injury 512 vs 45 p0001 and along with ARDS was an independent predictor of death 56 The magnitude of troponin elevation correlates modestly with the degree of hs CRP elevation 54 Dynamic increases in troponin were associated with a higher mortality rate 5461 Importantly the mechanism of cardiac injury may be multifactorial including demandischemia toxicity from direct viral injury stress inflammation microvascular dysfunction or plaque rupture as discussed later Central Illustration Arrhythmia Arrhythmias have been noted in several published reports In a case series of 138 hospitalized patients with COVID19 167 n 23 developed an unspecified arrhythmia during their hospitalization 52 higher rates were noted among patients admitted to the ICU 444 n 16 A case series of 187 hospitalized patients provided insight into specific arrhythmias reporting sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation amongst 59 n 11 of the patients 54 These findings are consistent with arrhythmias documented in influenza which has been known to cause both AV node dysfunction and ventricular arrhythmias 62 17 Heart failure cardiogenic shock and myocarditis Heart failure and myocardial dysfunction have been described in COVID19 5355586063 In a case series of 191 patients heart failure was noted as a complication of COVID19 in 23 n 44 of all patients and among 52 n 28 of nonsurvivors though the definition of heart failure was not clearly detailed 53 A smaller series of 21 elderly criticallyill patients in Washington State reported incident systolic dysfunction and cardiogenic shock in 7 patients 3355 Outside of this series the incidence of cardiogenic shock has not been reported Two case reports have documented cardiogenic shock in the setting of an elevated troponin ST elevations a reduction in left ventricular systolic function and no obstructive coronary disease in patients with COVID 196063 One report confirmed fulminant myocarditis by cardiac MRI60 Neither patient underwent endomyocardial biopsy Both were treated with inotropes and steroids with recovery of LV function The potential etiologies of the clinical myocarditis are discussed in detail below Central Illustration In one case series from China myocardial damage or heart failure contributed to 40 of deaths overall with 7 attributed to solely to circulatory failure without respiratory failure58 Thrombosis One of the prominent findings replicated across most early studies of COVID19 includes disarray of the coagulation and fibrinolytic system Hospitalized patients with moderate and severe COVID19 and those with poorer outcomes are noted to have prolonged prothrombin time PT elevated Ddimer and activated partial thromboplastin time APTT 35535464 In the context of a clinical picture that is consistent with disseminated intravascular thrombosis it is 18 reasonable to speculate that COVID19 would be associated with venous or arterial thrombi however the incidence has not been published A pathology report from SARSCoV1 demonstrated fibrin thrombi in 17 of 20 patients examined with 12 of them showing pulmonary infarcts 65 One preliminary case report which has not been peerreviewed from a COVID19 patient described autopsy findings of microthrombi in the pulmonary vasculature 66 While empiric anticoagulation is being used in some centers Personal communication Lorenzo Grazioli Papa Giovanni XXIII hospital in Bergamo Italy the absence of published data documenting thrombotic events in COVID19 routine use of anticoagulation is not recommended without evidence a thrombotic indication 67 Mortality COVID19 has a lower estimated case fatality rate CFR than its predecessors SARSCoV1 and MERSCoV which were 94 and 344 respectively 68 However given the high global burden of infection seen in COVID19 compared to SARS and MERS the absolute number of fatalities is staggeringly high crossing 70000 fatalities at the time of this review 69 CFR estimates have been challenging with SARSCoV2 as populations have not been widely screened for infection leading to an underestimate of the denominator and probable overestimate of the CFR Crude unadjusted estimates for the global CFR are 5 at the time writing with notable variation by country Italy 119 13155 deaths Spain 90 9387 deaths South Korea 17 169 deaths China 41 3312 deaths Iran 64 3036 deaths Germany 12 931 deaths and the United States 23 5137 deaths 69 Regional and national differences in CFR may be a result of multiple factors including a variable testing of the general and asymptomaticmildly symptomatic population b differing age across countries 19 c variable health care system resources and preparedness as well as d widely different public health measures for virus control Importantly as healthcare capacity is exceeded a large number of deaths may occur because of limited availability of critical care resources such as mechanical ventilation When adjusted for underlying demography and underascertainment of cases the CFR rate was estimated to be 14 in China 70 The general pattern of fatalities across the age groups appears to be consistent throughout the world In general greater age is associated with greater risk of severe disease as well as death According to the Chinese CDC report of over 70000 cases the agerelated CFR was as follows 1 in age 50 years 13 in age 5059 years 36 in age 6069 years 8 in age 7079 years and 148 in age 80 years and greater 45 This steep increase in agerelated mortality was also observed in Italy the US and South Korea 467172 In fact age along with markers of disease severity ddimer and sequential organ failure assessment SOFA score were the only independent predictors of mortality in one study 53 Multiple associations have been reported between baseline characteristics and comorbid conditions with mortality in COVID19 In univariate analyses of predictors of death Zhou and colleagues reported that age coronary heart disease diabetes hypertension respiratory rate SOFA score elevated WBC lymphocyte count creatinine lactate dehydrogenase high sensitivity troponin I Ddimer and elevated inflammatory markers such as ferritin IL6 and procalcitonin were associated with death 53 However in multivariable modeling only age OR 110 95 CI 103117 per year increase SOFA score OR 57 95 CI 26122 and elevated Ddimer 184 95 CI 26 1286 remained independent predictors of mortality as 20 described above 53 In another multivariate analysis of 416 patients from Wuhan after controlling for age baseline cardiovascular pulmonary and renal disease only presence of cardiac injury and development of ARDS were significantly associated with mortality 43 95 CI 1995 and 79 95 CI 37167 respectively56 It should be noted however that both of these complications tend to occur in older individuals 5673 Putative Mechanisms of Cardiovascular Manifestations in SARSCoV2 As mentioned in prior sections COVID19 patients present with highly variable acuities of disease and disease progression Cardiac injury is a common feature of the disease process and 40 of patients die with myocardial injury as a proximate finding 58 While multiple therapies are currently under development and in trials for treatment of COVID19 as discussed in a later section understanding the mechanisms of cardiac disease will be vital to effective and timely targeted treatment of this syndrome and its devastating sequelae Here we propose several putative mechanisms of COVID19induced cardiovascular disease Central Illustration Direct viral myocardial injury The presence of ACE2 receptors on the myocardium and vascular endothelial cells provides a theoretical mechanism for direct viral infection of the heart with resultant myocarditis Reports have documented clear cases of myocarditis syndromes 6063 However to date there no reports of biopsy proven SARSCoV2 viral myocarditis with viral inclusions or viral DNA detected in myocardial tissue The closely related SARSCoV1 has been documented to cause a viral myocarditis with detection of viral RNA in autopsied hearts 7475 In light of the shared 21 host cell entry receptor between SARSCoV2 and CoV1 a direct viral myocardial entry and resulting injury is plausible with SARSCoV2 as well 76 Another hypothesized mechanism of direct viral injury to the myocardium is through an infectionmediated vasculitis The ACE2 receptor is highly expressed in arterial and venous endothelial cells 24 There are pathologic data from SARSCoV1 showing evidence of vasculitis with monocyte and lymphocyte infiltration vascular endothelial cell injury and stromal edema in the heart 77 Either direct viral entry into myocardial endothelial cells could trigger a vasculitis or presence of virus could lead to an indirect immunological response and resulting hypersensitivity reaction 7879 This insult would be associated with myocardial injury and perhaps even overt myocardial dysfunction in COVID19 Microvascular injury Micro and macrothromboses were observed in autopsy evaluations of 3 patients who died from SARSCoV1 80 A prominent finding of SARSCoV2 is disarray of the coagulation and fibrinolytic system with 70 of nonsurvivors meeting criteria for DIC 81 It may be hypothesized that myocardial injury is a result of microthrombus formation in the myocardial vasculature in the setting of a hypercoagulable state like DIC Infections and sepsis are a leading cause of DIC in general 82 The exact mechanism of DIC in the setting of sepsis and ARDS is complex but is generally thought to be related to an immune mediated exhaustion of the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems promoting bleeding and thrombosis in the same patient 83 Endothelial injury and inflammatory cytokines such as IL 22 6 and TNFalpha upregulate tissue factor expression driving a prothombotic state 8487 Dysregulation of antithrombin III plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 PAI1 and protein C in the setting of significant inflammation and sepsis promote an anticoagulated state 8890 Furthermore platelet activation also ensues in the context of sepsis and inflammation further tipping the fine balance of the coagulation system 9194 In summary the hyperinflammation and immune activation seen in severe COVID19 infection is likely sufficient to trigger DIC microvascular dysfunction and myocardial injury Stress cardiomyopathy The role of stress Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in COVID19 related cardiac injury is not know n at this time with no cases in the literature currently However several of the proposed mechanisms of COVID19 related cardiac injury detailed in this review are also thought to be implicated in the pathophysiology of stress cardiomyopathy particularly those of microvascular dysfunction cytokine storm and sympathetic surge 95 Acute coronary syndrome Any discussion of myocardial injury would be incomplete without addressing the issue of acute coronary syndrome ACS and myocardial infarction MI The current published experience does not detail the incidence of ACS or epicardial plaque rupture as a mechanism for the acute cardiac injury observed in COVID19 However there is historical precedent for an association between infection and an elevated risk of ACS Epidemiologic studies have shown that hospitalization for pneumonia is associated with a higher risk for atherosclerotic events 96 Influenza infection has been well studied and shown to have a temporal association with 23 cardiovascular complications and acute coronary syndrome 9798 Annual vaccination against seasonal influenza was associated with a 36 lower rate of major adverse cardiovascular events in a metaanalysis of clinical trials evaluating this question 97 Therefore viral infection is associated with an increased risk for coronary events and prevention with a reduction in this risk Therefore it is plausible that ACS will also be an important cause of acute cardiac injury in patients with COVID19 Accordingly international societies have devised pathways and protocols to effectively treat COVID19 patients with ACS including appropriate and timely use of resources to ensure the best outcome for the patient while also maintaining provider safety 99 There are multiple pathophysiologic mechanisms by which systemic viral infection by influenza or SARSCoV2 for example may lead to a higher risk of plaque destabilization and ACS 100 The role of inflammation in the development and progression of atherosclerosis is well established 101102 The immune response to acute viral infection and the accompanying surge of cytokines and inflammatory mediators can lead to localized arterial inflammation which is more pronounced within coronary plaques 61103 Entry of viral products into the systemic circulation also known as pathogenassociated molecular patterns PAMPs can cause innate immune receptor activation which can cascade into activation of immune cells resident in pre existing atheromata driving plaque rupture 104 Viral PAMPs are also believed to activate the inflammasome resulting in conversion of procytokines into the biologically active cytokines 105 In addition dysregulation of coronary vascular endothelial function by infection and inflammation may lead to a more vasoconstricted coronary bed 106 All of these changes are 24 putative mechanisms by which COVID19 infection could lead to destabilization of preexisting atherosclerotic plaque driving an acute coronary event Myocardial injury secondary to oxygen supply and demand mismatch Periods of severe physiologic stress in the setting of sepsis and respiratory failure can be associated with elevations in biomarkers of myocardial injury and strain in some patients an entity that confers poorer prognosis107109 The mechanism of such myocardial injury is thought to be related to a mismatch between oxygen supply and demand without acute atherothrombotic plaque disruption and consistent with a diagnosis of type 2 myocardial infarction MI 100110 Indeed patients who suffer from type 2 MI compared to type 1 MI have higher mortality rates which may in part be explained by a higher burden of acute and chronic comorbid conditions in the type 2 MI population 111 Furthermore type 2 MI on the background of coronary artery disease CAD has a worse prognosis than those patients without CAD Given the age and comorbidity profile of patients hospitalized with severe COVID19 it is reasonable to assume that this population has a higher risk of underlying nonobstructive CAD and therefore the presence of type 2 MI in this population is likely a marker of and contributor to the poor outcomes of COVID19 patients with troponin elevations 56 Systemic hyperinflammatory response with resulting myocardial injury Perhaps one of the more intriguing mechanisms for cardiac injury in severe COVID19 patients stems from the significant systemic inflammatory response Early reports have demonstrated severely elevated levels of inflammatory biomarkers and cytokines including IL6 Creactive protein CRP tumor necrosis factor TNF interleukin IL2R and ferritin 112 Higher 25 levels of these biomarkers are associated with more severe COVID19 manifestations and worse outcomes A proposed theoretical model of COVID19 disease progression divides the course into three overlapping yet distinct stages In this staging framework stage I represents early viral infection with associated constitutional symptoms In stage II direct viral cytotoxicity of the pulmonary system with associated inflammatory activation leads to prominent respiratory system compromise associated with dyspnea and ultimately acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS and hypoxia With ACE2 receptors serving as an entrypoint for viral replication in type II pneumocytes the pulmonary system becomes the maiden organ of injury If the host is unable to clear the virus via a productive and protective immune response COVID19 progresses to stage III a hyperinflammatory state associated with profound elevations in inflammatory biomarkers Patients who reach stage III have severe COVID19 manifestations with multiorgan dysfunction and cytokine storm with immune dysregulating akin to that seen in cytokine release syndrome CRS associated with chimeric antigen receptor Tcell CART therapy 112116 This observation is basis for several investigational therapies in COVID19 including steroids and antiinflammatory agents as discussed later Prior studies have shown that cardiomyopathy in sepsis is partially mediated by inflammatory cytokines such as TNF IL6 IL1 INF and IL2 73 Recombinant TNF resulted in an early and sustained LV systolic dysfunction in canines 117 Cultured rat cardiomyocytes demonstrated reduced contractility when exposed to IL6 118 The mechanism may be through modulation of calcium channel activity with resultant myocardial dysfunction 119121 Additionally nitric oxide NO is also believed to be a mediator of myocardial depression in hyperinflammatory states such as sepsis Seminal studies found that medium from LPSactivated 26 macrophages suppressed myocyte contractility a finding reversed with the NO synthase inhibitor LNmonomethyl arginine 122 Finally recent understanding of the key role of mitochondrial dysfunction in septic states has raised questions about the role of this entity in sepsis associated cardiomyopathy 123 Indeed similar mechanisms are thought to possibly underly the pathophysiology of stress Takotsubo cardiomyopathy as well Potential Targeted or Disease Modifying Treatments in SARS CoV2 The preceding review of the viral physiology of SARSCoV2 and the various potential mechanisms of injury to the host serve as the basis for considering specific targeted treatment and prevention The following section outlines several current candidate classes of agents including a brief discussion of vaccine development Figure 1 Nucleotide Analogs Inhibitors of Viral Genome Replication The antiviral mechanism of nucleotide analogs is to interfere with RdRp function and viral genome replication and amplification Figure 1 There are no CoVspecific drugs available at this time and so ongoing efforts to employ this drug class against SARSCoV2 are reliant on pre existing agents designed for other viral illnesses 124 The most widelyapplied agent in this class against SARSCoV2 has been remdesivir 125 Remdesivir functions as a chain terminator of RNA replication initially designed for use against Ebola 124 Addition of remdesivir to the growing RNA strand by RdRp blocks the incorporation of additional nucleotides thereby halting genome replication 126127 The agent has been shown to have in vitro activity against SARSCoV2 leading to offlabel and 27 investigational use around the world 4125 Multiple randomizedcontrolled trials are ongoing in China and the United States for moderate severe and critical COVID19 NCT04292730 NCT04292899 NCT04252664 NCT04252664 NCT04292730 Another nucleotide analog for the disruption of RdRpdependent viral replication is favipiravir which has investigational approval in several countries 128129 Additional agents that are under study include emtricitabinetenofovir and ribavirin 128130 Protease Inhibitors Inhibitors of Nonstructural Protein Generation The antiviral mechanism of action of protease inhibitors is to block viral proteases which cleave the nonstructural proteins from the large monomeric replicase as detailed above Figure 1 As the maturation of nonstructural proteins such as RdRp is necessary for viral reproduction the pharmacologic impairment of the protease should be effective to stop viral replication A randomized control trial of lopinavirritonavir a combination protease inhibitor designed for HIV treatment in 199 patients with at least moderate COVID19 did not significantly alter clinical improvement or viral clearance 131 While the results of this trial were met with disappointment this negative study should not forestall trials and drug development of protease inhibitors as a therapeutic class given that this drug was not specifically designed for SARS CoV2 128 Indeed the development of inhibitors specific to SARSCoV2 main protease is underway A class of agents identified using structurebased drug design ketonamide inhibitors has demonstrated in vitro efficacy and favorable pharmacokinetics 132 Other candidate protease 28 inhibitors for SARSCoV2 include danoprevir a drug originally intended for HCV therapy 133 Inhibitors of Membrane Fusion In order for the viral genome to gain access to cellular machinery for replication a membrane fusion event must occur between the viral and endosomal membranes which are noncovalently bound by the interaction between the S protein and ACE2 The exact mechanism of membrane fusion is unknown but appears to be dependent on endosomal maturation and a membranebound host protease TMPRSS2 7 Chloroquine CQ Hydroxychloroquine HCQ The antiviral properties of chloroquine CQ were previously observed in HIV and other viruses 134135 CQ and HCQ are thought to inhibit endosomal maturation a process by which endosomes are translocated from the perimembrane regions of the cell to central hubs 136137 Figure 1 CQ prevented viral replication of SARSCoV1 in vitro 138 A followup study demonstrated comparable efficacy of HCQ a less toxic derivative and suggested that the mechanism of impaired endosomal maturation indeed applied to SARSCoV2 infection in vitro 139 Only poorquality nonrandomized unblinded data exists assessing the benefit of HCQ in COVID19 140 While HCQ is being widely used with an FDA emergency authorization more data are needed to prove efficacy against SARSCoV2 in humans Notably CQ and HCQ prolong the QT and may induce arrhythmia significant caution should be used in starting these agents in patients with a QTc500 ms Concomitant use of other QT prolonging agents is not recommended 29 Camostat Camostat is a protease inhibitor approved for the treatment of chronic pancreatitis Camostat appears to inhibit TMPRSS2 in proteomic and in vitro studies 7141 A randomized placebo controlled trial is underway for this agent in COVID19 NCT04321096 Figure 1 Neutralizing Antibodies and Decoy Proteins Neutralizing antibodies are designed to bind virions preventing viral exposure or binding to host cells Figure 1 Plasma from patients who have recovered from SARSCoV2 may contain anti SARSCoV2 IgG antibodies In a small singlearm trial of convalescent plasma in COVID19 patients with ARDS all had clinical improvement with 35 patients weaning from the ventilator 142 Additional trials are ongoing to better define the safety and efficacy of this strategy Isolation of SARSCoV2 specific neutralizing antibodies with clonal techniques is an appealing strategy to provide targeted therapy potentially with lower risk of adverse events Strategies currently under investigation include antibodies cloned from convalescent serum of individuals recovered from SARSCoV2 or SARSCoV1 and synthetic antibodies It is unclear whether differences in the S proteins of SARSCoV1 and SARSCoV2 may limit the effectiveness of antibodies cloned from patients convalescent to SARSCo V1 9 Synthetic antibodies represent an exciting novel therapeutic avenue One strategy being explored is to fuse ACE2 to Fc IgG with the hypothesis that this synthetic antibody would serve as a decoy receptor preventing cellular binding of the virion 143 30 In a similar vein studies are ongoing of decoy proteins that are designed to act as viral sinks There is preliminary success with this strategy using soluble human ACE2 34 Central Illustration AntiInflammatory Therapy Advanced stages of COVID19 have been likened to cytokine storm syndromes with non specific widespread immune activation 114 Elevated levels of inflammatory biomarkers such as IL6 and hs CRP identify patients at high risk of progressing to severe disease and death 53 Immunomodulatory and antiinflammatory therapy have been used despite limited data in patients with evidence of hyperinflammation in an effort to curb pathologic immune activation Corticosteroids Corticosteroids have been used in several severe viral respiratory infections including influenza SARSCoV and MERSCoV with limited benefit and in some instances evidence of delayed viral clearance and increased rates of secondary infection and mortality 144 A retrospective analysis of 84 patients with ARDS secondary to SARSCoV2 observed an association with improved survival in patients who received solumedrol 51 In the absence of robust evidence major professional society guidelines do not recommend routine use of corticosteroids in treatment of COVID19 but rather restricting it s use to patients with other indications for steroids such as refractory shock or advanced ARDS 41 Clinical trials are ongoing to examine the safety and efficacy of corticosteroids in hospitalized noncritically ill COVID19 patients Clinical Trialsgov ID NCT 04273321 and in those with ARDS Clinical Trialsgov ID NCT04323592 31 IL6 Inhibitors Elevation of IL6 in patients with severe COVID19 has prompted consideration of use of IL6 inhibitors Tocilizumab Siltuximab extrapolating from treatment of cytokine release syndrome 145 Tociluzimab a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody and Siltuximab a chimeric monoclonal antibody both bind soluble and membrane bound IL6 receptors resulting in inhibition of IL6 mediated signaling In one preprint case series from China 21 patients with severe or critical COVID19 treated with tocilizumab experienced a salutary effect with resolution of fever improved oxygenation improvement in lung opacities on chest CT resolution of lymphopenia and a reduction in CRP levels within a few days of therapy in the absence of any significant reported adverse events 146 In this preliminary report 19 patients were discharged alive and 2 remained hospitalized at the time the case series was published Several randomized clinical trials of tocilizumab in treatment of severe COVID19 infection are ongoing NCT04317092 NCT04306705 Azithromycin Azithromycin a macrolide antibiotic has long been touted for its antiinflammatory effect and has been used as adjunctive therapy in treatment of community acquired pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations 147 Limited data suggest that adjunctive azithromycin in moderatesevere ARDS is associated with improved outcomes 148 A small nonrandomized study showed that combination azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine was associated with more effective SARSCoV2 clearance in COVID19 patients compared with either monotherapy with hydroxychloroquine or standard of care however numerous limitations 32 of this study render the data uninterpretable 140 QT interval monitoring is prudent especially when used in combination with hydroxychloroquine Several randomized clinical trials assessing the combination of hydroxychloroquinechloroquine with azithromycin across the severity spectrum of COVID19 are ongoing or about be launched NCT 04321278 NCT04322396 NCT04322123 NCT04324463 Other AntiInflammatory Therapies JAK2 inhibitors inhibit receptor mediatedendocytosis leading to the hypothesis that it might prevent cellular entry of the SARSCoV2 Figure 1 Additionally this class of agents have anti inflammatory effects by inhibiting cytokine release 149 An agent in the class baricitinib is being studied in an openlabel nonrandomized pilot study in patients with COVID19 NCT04320277 Currently a 3 arm randomized control trial is being launched to compare anakinra monotherapy emapalumab monotherapy and standard of care NCT04324021 Anakinra is a recombinant monoclonal antibody that blocks IL1 receptors It has been used to treat autoimmune conditions including juvenile idiopathic arthritis as well as recurrent pericarditis Emapalumab is a fully human antigamma interferon monoclonal antibody that has been approved by the FDA for treatment of primary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis a disease reminiscent of the hyperinflammatory state seen in advanced COVID19 Finally colchicine a microtubule polymerization inhibitor and antiinflammatory drug is being tested in a large randomized clinical trial of ambulatory COVID19 patients NCT04322682 Other Therapies Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors Angiotensin Receptor Blockers 33 ACE2 receptor mediated endocytosis of SARSCoV2 is central to the viral life cycle Conflicting data exist regarding the effect of reninangiotensinaldosteroneinhibitors RAAS i including ACEI and ARB on ACE2 activitylevels in various human tissues and the resultant susceptibility to infection with SARSCoV2 18 The totality of the available data is insufficient to recommend cessation of ACEIARB in individuals with an existing indication for lifeprolonging therapy with these drugs and major societies have strongly recommended continuation of ACEIARB therapy An open label randomized trial is on the way to examine the effect of prophylactic ACEIARB withdrawal in COVID19 naive individuals with essential hypertension as the sole indication for treatment on the risk of infection and subsequent complications NCT04330300 Based on the preclinical data described earlier in this review two paired trials are currently underway examining losartan therapy in COVID19 who are ambulatory NCT04311177 and hospitalized NCT04312009 Statins The antiinflammatory pleiotropic effects of statins have been cultivated in different pathologic states Statins have been shown in murine models of acute lung injury and in humans to attenuate the inflammatory component of acute lung injury 150151 A multicenter randomized trial of simvastatin in patients with versatile causes of ARDS showed no difference as compared to placebo in ventilator free days multiorgan failure and mortality 152 A subsequent study subphenotyping the trial population in to hyper vs hypoinflammatory ARDS found a statistically significant improvement in survival with simvastatin in the hyperinflammatory group 153 A posthoc analysis of the JUPITER trial observed a reduction 34 in incident pneumonia with rosuvastatin 154 The benefit of statin therapy in the hyperinflammatory state in advanced COVID19 is unknown Vaccines Against SARSCoV2 As discovery of a safe and efficacious vaccine again SARSCoV2 is clearly the aspiration for preventative strategies intense efforts are ongoing employing numerous approaches with accelerated testing It is believed that all 4 structural proteins E M N and S proteins may serve as antigens for neutralizing antibody and CD4 CD8 T cell responses 155 Based on the experience with SARSCoV1 vaccine development it seems that the most promising candidates target the S protein which induces humoral and protective cellular immunity 8 Encouragingly administration of fulllength or the ACE2receptor binding domain of the S protein of SARSCoV1 induced highly potent neutralizing antibodies that conveyed protective immunity in animal models 156157 Potential delivery strategies include inactivated or attenuated virus subunit vaccines viral vectors DNA or RNAbased vaccines 158 Live attenuated viral vaccines are likely to induce significant immune response but may carry risk of disease particularly in immunosuppressed individuals Inactivated whole viral or subunit vaccines are relatively easy to develop but do not induce immediate or complete immunity typically requiring multiple doses to promote humoral but often not cellular immunity Immunity may also wane over time requiring booster dosing Viral vectorbased vaccines would employ other viruses such as the vaccina virus a poxvirus used for the smallpox vaccine or adenovirus to display SARSCoV2 antigens This strategy can promote robust cytotoxic T cell responses but may fail in the face of the preexisting 35 immunity to or toxicity of the viral vector 159 Nucleic acidbased strategies which work through delivery of DNA or RNA that are translated by host machinery to produce viral protein antigens are relatively simple to design but may be limited by toxicity andor stability concerns Of note at this time there are no approved DNA or RNA vaccines for humans Most approaches to SARSCoV2 are in preclinical development with several early trials of RNA NCT04283461 and viralvector NCT04299724 NCT 04313127 NCT04276896 vaccine strategies ongoing Crisis Standards of Care and Ethical Resource Allocation Estimates suggest that as has happened in Italy and Spain the burden of COVID19 will far outstrip the healthcare capacity in the US and globally with insufficient availability of hospital and ICU bed capacity healthcare providers and specific therapeutic or supportive interventions such as mechanical ventilation and renal replacement 160 For this reason organizations such as the Italian Society of Anesthesia Analgesia Resuscitation and Intensive Care SIAARTI and individual healthcare institutions are developing guidance for allocation of resources in the event that adequate additional resources can not be obtained 161 These efforts are building off of a set of principles established in the wake of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic At that time the US Department of Health and Human Services commissioned the Institute of Medicine IOM to provide expert guidance on implementing alternative standards of healthcare in the setting of a disaster In their report the IOM defined the principles of crisis standards of care defined as a substantial change in usual healthcare operations including the level of care possible to deliver in the setting of a pervasive or catastrophic disaster 162 Notably this 36 framework recognizes that the formal declaration that crisis standards of care are in operation enables specific legalregulatory powers and protection for healthcare providers in the necessary task of allocating and using scarce medical resources Appreciating the distress associated with allocation of scarce medical resources the IOM recommend that the process be guided by seven ethical principles fairness duty to care duty to steward resources transparency consistency proportionality and accountability 162 Working with these principles ethicists have come to a general consensus that the goal is to maximize benefit while maintaining equity objectivity and transparency 160163 Maximizing benefit ideally involves preserving the most lives as well as the most lifeyears acknowledging the importance of prognosis While the practical application of these principles is challenging there appears to be general agreement across the literature on a number of concepts 160163164 Most recommend development of a triage or scoring system that accounts for acute and premorbid prognosis in order to allocate scarce resources to those who are most likely to benefit The scoring system should utilize objective clinical information in order to minimize the need for clinical judgement and the risk of introducing inconsistency and bias The use of the system and the determination that stems from it should be transparent to providers patients and families Triage should be applied broadly to all patients requiring a particular resource not just those suffering from the pandemic disease eg applies to decision to use VA ECMO in patients with myocarditis due to COVID19 and cardiogenic shock from a non COVID19 etiology A random system eg lottery should be used to break ties in cases with a similar estimated prognosis rather than a firstcomefirst serve approach Importantly many advocate that an independent triage physician make the determination to remove the 37 burden from the bedside healthcare team The triage physician may be supported as necessary by a triage committee comprised of experts in the area of ethics and relevant medical fields Areas of controversy include whether there should be priority allowed for healthcare providers Some ethicists argue that they should not be prioritized as that are unlikely to recovery in a time frame that would allow them to continue their professional responsibilities 163 Others argue that granting priority recognizes the assumption of risk and also encourages ongoing participation in patient care 160 Along the same line an argument has also been made to prioritize research participation 160 The optimal tool for prognostication also remains elusive The sequential organ failure assessment SOFA score has been suggested as quantitative assessment of acute illness severity however there is a recognition that this tool may not be well calibrated to all populations and could lead to inaccurate assessments of prognosis 165166 The value of predetermination of this framework with community and provider engagement establishment of legal authority and logistic and operational preparedness is clear Nevertheless acknowledging the prospect of largescale rationing of healthcare is heartbreaking and foreign to most civilian healthcare providers in developed countries Summary In just a few short months SARSCoV2 has spread across the world with distressing speed threatening global economic and individual health and wellbeing Many regional healthcare 38 systems are overwhelmed and underresourced forcing clinicians and administrators to make previously unthinkable decisions regarding allocation of medical care However in the wake of this devastation clinicians and scientists have rallied together to rapidly evolve our understanding of all aspects of SARSCoV2 infection from the basic virology to the human manifestations to therapeutic and preventative strategies This unprecedented collective effort will without a doubt advance our ability to prevent the spread and optimally care for patients suffering from COVID19 Acknowledgments manuscript The authors would like to acknowledge Andrew Karaba MD PhD for his review of the 39 Figure Legends Figure 1 Putative SARSCoV2 Life Cycle and Therapeutic Targets The SARS2CoV2 virus binds to the ACE2 receptor on the host cell membrane Endocytosis is believed to be mediated in part by JAK2 Membrane fusion occurs between the mature endosome and virion with facilitation by the transmembrane serine protease 2 TMPRSS2 resulting in release of the SARSCoV2 RNA into the intracellular space The RNA is translated by host machinery to produce the replicase and structural proteins Host and SARSCoV2 proteases cleave the replicase to in nonstructural proteins including the RNAdependent RNA polymerase RdRp RdRp mediates SARSCoV2 RNA replication and amplification SARS CoV2 transmembrane proteins S E and M are shuttled via the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus to the forming viral capsids Viral assembly occurs with addition of the viral RNA and N protein through association with the transmembrane viral proteins Exocytosis results in release of the newly synthesized viral particle 40
