syndrome coronavirus 2 or SARSCoV2 was identified as the etiologic agent of an outbreak of pneumonia in the city of Wuhan province of Hubei in China The virus had a rapid dissemination with persontoperson transmission and cases soon identified throughout the world The disease was called COVID19 coronavirus disease 2019 with several new outbreaks related to community transmission It is now classified as pandemic14 We have observed an increase in requests of chest computed tomography CT since the first records of cases in Brazil therefore in a near future the current installed capacity of the system to analyze and produce the CT reports may be exceeded It is crucial to highlight that the definite diagnosis of COVID19 is made by realtime polymerase chain reaction RTPCR and a normal negative chest CT does not rule out diagnosis However currently the RTPCR result has taken longer than CT reports to be available so CT has taken an important role in a comprehensive assessment of patients for demonstrating high sensitivity although low specificity to detect the most frequent pulmonary findings of the disease In this high demand urgency context to provide results it is advisable that the content of the radiological report be very objective and as clear as possible for the requesting physicians from the emergency department The most relevant pieces of information to be conveyed are presence or not of pulmonary involvement if the findings are compatible with infectious process and in positive cases if the changes are suggestive of viral etiology particularly COVID19 even if there is overlapping of findings with other infectious diseases including other viruses We also included an approximate estimate of extent of pulmonary involvement by the disease visual analysis which has been considered useful by them in management of patients together with other clinical data and physical examination In our Institution involvement of 50 of parenchyma5 has been used as an additional criterion to decide for hospitalization In a structured report we initially describe if there are pulmonary changes or not and if they are suggestive of a pulmonary infectious process In case 1 How to cite this article Shoji H Fonseca EK Teles GB Passos RB Yanata E Silva MM et al Structured thoracic computed tomography report for COVID19 pandemic einstein So

described in COVID19 including groundglass opacities sometimes with superimposed interlobular septal thickening crazy paving consolidations and reversed halo presenting a bilateral multilobar distribution predominantly peripheral with mild predilection for the posterior regions and lower lobes 610 In these cases we have highlighted in our reports that the possibility of COVID19 should be considered in the differential diagnoses and also included the estimated extent of parenchyma involvement greater or lesser than 505 Figure 1 shows a case with typical imaging findings of COVID19 and the model of provided report In patients with findings more suggestive of other type of infection which obviously tomographic must not be neglected amidst the pandemic we have described the changes and concluded as follows Such findings are compatible with pulmonary infectious process and its characteristics are not typically observed in cases of pulmonary involvement by COVID19 other etiologic agents should be initially considered in the differential diagnosis As examples of changes described in the literature as uncommon in cases of COVID19 which increase the probability of infection by other agents we underline numerous centrilobular micronodules with treeinbud pattern relatively well defined solid nodules cavities predominant central parenchyma involvement mainly affecting the airways 69 Figure 2 displays an example of one of those cases and its respective report with final diagnosis of tuberculosis after complete investigation Figure 1 Computed tomography image of a confirmed case of COVID19 with typical findings and its respective report Figure 2 Computed tomography images of a case with initial clinical suspicion of COVID19 and its respective report with tomographic findings suggestive of infectious process but with characteristics that are not usual in COVID19 After performing ancillary investigations the diagnosis was pulmonary tuberculosis 2

pulmonary infectious process we clearly and explicitly report the following phrase Absence of focal pulmonary opacities suggestive of active parenchymal infectious process Next other additional relevant findings are briefly included emphasizing the presence or not of lymph node enlargement pleural effusion as well as pulmonary nodules emphysema chronic interstitial disease aneurysms and marked atheromatous disease Developing structured reports in radiology primarily those oriented to certain diseases provides several benefits including clarity in conveying information to requesting physicians and use of a common terminology enabling all those involved to be familiar with specific terms used for each disease Moreover this later enables collecting data for epidemiological purposes quality control and research 1112 Other advantages comprise increased radiologist productivy with less burden 12 Implementing a structured report should be beneficial particularly in the current scenario of COVID19 pandemic for increasing productivity of radiologists and enabling better understanding of the requesting physicians with a potential positive impact in management of patients 1 3
