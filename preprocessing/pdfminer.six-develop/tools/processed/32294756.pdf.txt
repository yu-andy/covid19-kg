Editorial Nonpharmaceutical interventions for tackling the COVID19 epidemic in Brazil doi 105123S167949742020000200009 COVID19 was detected in Wuhan China in December 2019 In view of the growing number of cases deaths and affected countries on January 30th 2020 the World Health Organization WHO declared the event to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern In Brazil the epidemic was declared a Public Health Emergency of National Concern on February 3rd 20202 3 Following notification of over 110000 cases and 4000 deaths in countries on all continents on March 11th 2020 WHO declared that COVID19 had become pandemic In the absence of prior immunity in the human population and with no vaccine against SARSCo V2 the causative agent of COVID19 its highly virulent nature means that case numbers grow exponentially Nonpharmaceutical interventions NPIs are indicated in this context aimed at inhibiting transmission between humans slowing the spread of the disease and consequently reducing and delaying the peak of its occurrence on the epidemiological curve4 In this way it is possible to reduce instantaneous demand for health care and mitigate the consequences of the disease for peoples health including minimizing associated morbidity and mortality Figure 15 Pandemic outbreak No intervention s e s a C y l i a D 1 Goal of Community Mitigation 1 2 3 Delay

curve showing the normal course of the epidemic and flattening of the curve expected by adopting nonpharmaceutical interventions Source Adapted from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC 2007 NPIs are public health measures with personal environmental and community scope Individual measures include hand hygiene respiratory etiquette and social distancing In turn social distancing involves case isolation quarantine of contacts and the voluntary practice of not frequenting places where many people are gathered together5 Another personal measure is the use of masks recommended for people with confirmed or suspected coronavirus and their carers WHO recommends that asymptomatic people should not use masks due to lack of evidence as to 1 Epidemiol Serv Saude Braslia 292e2020222 2020 their effectiveness in reducing influenza transmission apart from giving a false sense of protection Furthermore there are no studies on the effectiveness of mask use by asymptomatic people for preventing COVID19 transmission Environmental measures refer to rooms being well ventilated and exposed to the sun as well as routine cleaning of indoor environments and other surfaces these being procedures that help to eliminate the virus5 SARSCoV2 like the influenza virus can remain stable outside the human body in aerosols and on various surfaces for up to three days as in the case of plastic and stainless steel7 Special attention must be paid to cleaning elevator buttons handrails public transport hand straps door handles card terminal buttons smartphones workstations among other objects and surfaces which if contaminated can contribute to spreading viruses Community measures are actions taken by managers employers andor community leaders to protect the population They include restricting access to schools universities community gathering places public transport as well as other places where large numbers of people gather such as social and sports events theaters cinemas and commercial establishments which are not characterized as providing essential services 5 The starting time and duration of the various community NPIs will influence their impact It is a considerable challenge to determine the best time to start such interventions as if they are implemented too soon this can result in economic and social hardships without any benefit for public health and over time can result in intervention fatigue and the population ceasing to commit to the intervention On the other hand implementation once the disease has become widespread can limit the benefits for public health It needs to start soon enough to prevent the initial sharp rise in the number of cases and last for long enough to cover the peak of the expected epidemic curve5 In view of the knowledge gaps inherent to a new disease and considering the similarity between the behavior patterns of SARSCoV2 and the viruses that cause pandemic influenza the strategies adopted in pandemic influenza contingency plans are being considered for the COVID19 pandemic The guidelines of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC on pandemic influenza mitigation indicate that the time to start interventions should be based on assessments of disease severity8 Assessment of COVID19 in accordance with the CDC Pandemic Severity Assessment Framework PSAF has indicated that the disease has high transmissibility and clinical severity9 In view of the severity of the disease and the intensity of community transmission the use of community NPIs to mitigate the COVID19 pandemic is justified 10 Measures such as home quarantine for infected people social distancing and reduction in public gatherings such as church services as well as closing schools were implemented during the 19181919 influenza pandemic in several cities in the United States 11 During the 2009 influenza pandemic home quarantine was found to be feasible and achieved good uptake in Australia12 The experience of China suggests that NPIs which included strict lockdown measures such as those adopted in the city of Wuhan with effect from January 23rd 2020 contributed to suppressing the COVID19 epidemic in that country 4 13 On February 6th 2020 Brazil enacted Law No 13979 which makes provisions for measures to address the COVID19 epidemic and lists the community NPIs that can be adopted The countrys Federative Units began to adopt these measures with effect from the second week of March 2020 Examples include the state of Rio de Janeiro Decree No 46970 dated March 13th 202014 the Federal District Decree No 40520 dated March 14th 202015 the city of So Paulo Decree No 59283 dated March 16th 202016 and the state of Santa Catarina Decree No 515 dated March 17th 202017 which subsequently approved new decrees establishing stricter measures It is expected and desirable that actions to fight the epidemic will be reviewed and altered as it unfolds It is noteworthy that the state of So Paulo the countrys most populous state adopted rigorous quarantine measures with effect from March 24th 202018 It should be highlighted that for some NPIs to be implemented conditions of vulnerability peculiar to population subgroups need to be taken into consideration such as street dwellers people deprived of liberty the institutionalized elderly 18 people living in overcrowded households households without adequate ventilation or without running water migrants people with special needs people who live alone among others Moreover adopting these measures has important impacts on everyday activities on peoples lives and on society For example children stop going to school their studies are interrupted and they lose their access to school 2 Editorial Epidemiol Serv Saude Braslia 292e2020222 2020 meals Restricting social contact can have consequences for peoples mental and physical health particularly in the case of children and the elderly 4 19 Workers may be stopped from going to work may need to alter their routines so as to work from home or may lose their jobs or sources of income Women and children in particular become more vulnerable to domestic and intrafamily violence People families companies and countries are also expected to face economic losses Within this context it is fundamental for the Brazilian National Health System SUS and the other areas of the social protection system to work together in an articulated manner so as to favor peoples uptake of NPIs and minimize the detrimental impacts of community measures Protecting public health must guide decisions to be taken by government managers It is fundamental for these decisions to be based on the best available evidence and for them to be communicated in a transparent manner in order to gain the populations trust Guidance given by authorities and peoples uptake of NPIs will be determining factors for the course of the COVID19 epidemic in Brazil Leila Posenato Garcia1
