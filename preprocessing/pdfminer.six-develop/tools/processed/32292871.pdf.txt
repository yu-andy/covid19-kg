the world is in the early stages of dealing with a novel strain of coronavirus that emerged in China and spread worldwide Whilst research is being conducted on and about the virus the topic of this editorial is not the virus per se rather a reflection of the implications for our field I look at how we stand compared with adjacent fields and the implications for health economics HE 1 Where Health Economics Compares Well Over the past few weeks models of the pandemic have started to emerge Like many economists I have read these with interest The focus of models available to date differs from those we typically see in focussing on the spread over time rather than the total impact but they are not far removed from the models regularly published in HE espe cially where infectious diseases are involved 1 However as a whole we do seem to compare favourably as a disci pline in two areas transparency and sensitivity analysis On the transparency front seldom will you find an HE presentation paper or material that does not include a model diagram and a table of inputs Although it may not always be possible to perfectly recreate models from reported data we can get fairly close 2 This has not been the case for many of the COVID19 models released to date They may have been written up under time pressure and thus are not nec essarily generalisable to the models built by entire fields but it is hard to critique a model properly without seeing the inputs used Similarly model and data structures are vitally important and can determine much of the shape of the final results Anthony J Hatswell ahatswelldeltahatcouk 1 Delta Hat Nottingham UK 2 Department of Statistical Science UCL London UK More reassuring is the approach we take as a discipline to sensitivity and scenario analysis As modellers we know that some inputs are massively influential on results and rarely are we certain of their true values Given this uncer tainty it is rare to find HE work without extensive sensitiv ity analysis to consider both the parameter and the struc tural uncertaintiesmore often than not accounting for the correlation between parameters Of the epidemiological models reported to date too few have taken such a rigorous approachin many cases relying on point estimates with little consideration of other states of the world Where outputs are similar probabilistic estimates may be approxi mated by deterministic runs for expediency for example in sensitivity analysis However even then for the main results the underlying uncertainty should be propagated through models especially where so many unknowns exist 3 2 What Health Economics Can Learn From theCOVID19 Work Presented to Date Although HE does appear to perform strongly in presenting numerical summaries of model results research is increas ingly showing the importance of how uncertainty is commu nicated 4 Even when we have many facts at our disposal we are considerably more certain of some facts than oth ersfor example in the case of COVID19 the number of deaths as opposed to the number of cases which is depend ent on how many tests are performed and on whom To reflect uncertainty the UK government scientific advisors have stated not only estimates but also their confidence in their estimates of effect sizes 5 This approach was taken from another highprofile modelling effort of even greater importance than COVID19that of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC 6 Given the volume of evidence that is surrounded by uncertainty the IPCC have sought to standardise the Vol0123456789 AJHatswell language used to communicate uncertainty backed by behavioural science research If the IPCC provides esti mates or statements they use a standardised language an outcome stated to be very likely in all cases will mean it is predicted to happen with 90100 probability The IPCC work then goes further by discussing the degree of agree ment in the evidence low medium or high and the quality of evidence limited medium or robust 7 Standardisation of an approach to describing uncertainty in HE would avoid misinterpretation both within and outside our discipline using a common currency As a starting point we could do a lot worse than adopting the excellent work of the IPCC as has been done for COVID19 scientific advice The second area where HE could stand to learn is in involvement and impact on policy and the media Over the past weeks terminology from other areas such as R0 the basic reproduction number of a disease and exponential growth have made their way into common parlance How ever HE has not for whatever reason managed to convey the concept of opportunity cost Sadly media discussions on the level of lockdown required around the world present a false dichotomy between lives and the economy generally defined as gross domestic product As a field we know that tradeoffs are regularly made between health and wealth ultimately because of the problem of scarce resources More concerning is the near absent discussion around the oppor tunity cost of the policies pursued in terms of health impact This applies to the direct effects of postponing usual care and enforcing isolation on households with health impacts but also indirectly the health gains that could be achieved with more funding in less exceptional times Some notable examples of prioritisation are coming to light 8 but once HE models have been produced we will see estimates of cost per lifeyear potentially quality adjusted which will lay bare the choices that have been made If decisions are shown to be cost effective this will seemingly be by accident as opposed to by design 3 Implications forHealth Economics However the crisis that has emerged has shone a light on other areas that HE is not alone in facing The first of these is the speed of science and peer review Given the rapidly evolving nature of the situation preprints have played a large role in the scientific discussion Some of these are excellent 9 but many contain notable flaws andor unstated limitations and would be unlikely to be accepted for publica tion in their existing formatunderlining the importance of peer review as quality control There have been examples of good science done quickly 10 butfor the most part as would be expectedpublication incorporating peer review can not keep up In COVID19 this can be explained by how quickly the virus and containment measures have emerged but it is not explainable in our fieldin what have been less urgent times HE can not and should not try to speed up the scientific process or dictate to other groupsespecially on something as fast moving as the current crisis However we can get our own house in order At present it is not unusual to wait 6 months or more for peer review commentsleading to work appearing in press over a year or more since it was sub mitted indeed submission and formatting of papers can be a painful process in itself At the same time as researchers we are inundated with peer review requests in addition to our actual jobsthese come with little recognition or apprecia tion A more sustainable solution needs to be found likely involving public recognition andor some form of token monetary reward At its foundation the peerreviewed publication process exists to deliver thoroughly reviewed research in a timely manner It is an expensive exercise but is increasingly not delivering as the volume of research has increased Since most of us have had to rapidly become accustomed to vide oconferencing perhaps this lockdown time could be used to gather stakeholders and look for a more expedient and fairer way of doing things Simpler processes for submis sion for authors a charter of minimum standards for journals to adhere to in review time decision times and time to online publication and recognition for reviewers whatever appropriate form that may take For some publications this will only formalise what they are doing already for others it would give authors reassurance on how their work will be handled A second reflection is on the rule of rescue 11 and whether we truly understand public preferences Interest ingly the UK National Institute for Care and Excellence NICE Citizens Council only suggested an exception of exceeding standard thresholds to avert an epidemic as opposed to dealing with the reality of one 12 We acknowl edge society is prepared to spend more to save identifiable individuals Chilean miners the Thai cave rescue and many more examplesthis is the rule of rescue But does this also extend to saving unidentifiable individuals from iden tifiable diseases ie from COVID19 If so this has impli cations for health technology assessmentevery disease assessed becomes special by virtue of having a spotlight shone on it Since the original work on this topic was pro duced we have also had the introduction of the 24h news cycle and especially social media McKie and Richardson 11 discussed at length the role of mediaset priorities and their comments are worth rereading and perhaps revisiting in this new era A more general reflectionimplication relates to the unprecedented at least during peacetime changes enforced on society and healthcare services as a result of COVID19 These changes show that the existing systems are social constructsthings can be done differently if the will exists If systems are now acknowledged as malleable and this is maintained this gives HE a chance to propose ways to improve the efficiency of healthcare systems rather than needing to treat them as fixed and work within them This could increase the scope of potential health gains and be a small positive we can take from the current situation Acknowledgements The author thanks Howard Thom Gianluca Baio Simone Critchlow and
