pathogenic viral strains is a constant threat to global health with the new coronavirus strain COVID19 as the latest example COVID19 caused by the SARSCoV2 virus has quickly spread around the globe This pandemic demands rapid development of drugs and vaccines Plantbased vaccines are a technology with proven viability which have led to promising results for candidates evaluated at the clinical level meaning this technology could contribute towards the ght against COVID19 Herein a perspective in how plantbased vaccines can be developed against COVID19 is presented Injectable vaccines could be generated by using transient expression systems which oer the highest protein yields and are already adopted at the industrial level to produce VLPsvaccines and other biopharmaceuticals under GMPCprocesses Stablytransformed plants are another option but this approach requires more time for the development of antigenproducing lines Nonetheless this approach oers the possibility of developing oral vaccines in which the plant cell could act as the antigen delivery agent Therefore this is the most attractive approach in terms of cost easy delivery and mucosal immunity induction The development of multiepitope rationallydesigned vaccines is also discussed regarding the experience gained in expression of chimeric immunogenic proteins in plant systems Keywords zoonosis multiepitope vaccine molecular farming oral vaccines epitopebased vaccine mucosal immunization 1 Introduction The coronaviruses CoVs are enveloped viruses having a positivesense singlestranded genomic RNA 1 and are grouped into four genera CoVs CoVs CoVs and CoVs The ones that aect mammals are and CoVs while the other two genera infect birds and could also infect mammals 2 Lately the coronavirus has become a remarkable concern for global health after the diagnosis of a cluster of unknown pneumonia patients in December 2019 in Wuhan China The outbreak was associated with workers in the Wuhan Wholesale Seafood Market in which live exotic animals are sold 3 The pathogen was named SARSCoV2 given its similarity 70 of genomic similarity to SARSCoV1 which was responsible for the 20022003 severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic SARS Until now the ocial and accepted name for this new coronavirus strain is COVID19 virus an acronym for coronavirus infectious disease 2019 1 A systematic genomic analysis has revealed 380 amino acid substitutions between SARSCoV1 and SARSCo V2 which is a starting point to study its functional and pathogenic divergence 4 Vaccines 2020 8 183

the world Every continent has reported presence of the virus and the World Health Organization has declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020 1 On 11 March 2020 pandemic status was announced This is the rst pandemic caused by a coronavirus species The symptoms associated with COVID19 comprise ulike symptoms including fever cough dyspnea myalgia and asthenia SARSCoV2 can cause pneumonia acute respiratory distress syndrome sepsis and septic shock that can lead to death 5 COVID19 patients usually exhibit fever and lower respiratory tract symptoms and the estimated incubation time for the disease is 14 days The most accepted COVID19 diagnosis method is realtime PCR to detect its genomic RNA which was implemented thanks to the rapid sequencing and availability of the genomic sequence The processing of respiratory or blood samples allows detection in a few hours 2 At the end of March the global number of conrmed cases of COVID19 was around 441000 which has led to approximately 20000 deaths in 172 countriesregions 6 China has the majority of the cases with more than 81000 cases recorded followed by Italy with more than 69000 recorded cases 1 Health control measures mainly include drugs to relieve symptoms and maintain vital functions The most frequent form of humanhuman transmission is by spread through aerial drops that are discharged upon sneezing coughing or exhaling 7 Additionally transmission by contact is also prominent especially through the oral nasal and ocular mucous membranes 8 Therefore the main immediate measures to prevent transmission include hand washing wearing masks and following good hygiene practices when coughing and sneezing 9 2 Development of Therapeutic and Prophylactic Treatments against COVID19 Presently there is no specic treatment for COVID19 As an emerging pathogen several knowledge gaps exist about the SARSCoV2 virus and the coming months will be critical to rene clinical management and advancement in the validation of possible treatments A myriad of eorts is ongoing to perform clinical trials and determine the ecacy of preexisting drugs with hydroxychloroquine and Remdesivir as the most promising candidates 10 Receptor blockers are also under evaluation 11 along with the assessment and development of monoclonal antibodies Moreover transfusions using plasma from individuals recovered from SARSCoV2 infection containing neutralizing antibodies are under exploration with promising ndings 12 Nonetheless vaccination is the most eective approach to control and ultimately eradicate infectious diseases Since SARSCoV2 possesses high transmissibility asymptomatic and presymptomatic virus shedding which results in a high number of patients with mild symptoms the development of vaccines is an urgent goal to ght against this pathogen The straightforward path to generate vaccine candidates is the technology of inactivated vaccines which can be formulated with SARSCoV2 virions previously inactivated by chemical or physical treatments A vaccine based on liveattenuated virus is another possible approach 13 For SARSCoV1 and MERSCoV inactivated vaccine candidates have induced robust humoral responses leading to virus neutralization Alternatively the construction of a chimeric attenuated virus constitutes an interesting path For instance the inuenza virus can be used as a scaold to expose SARSCoV2 antigens and generate a bivalent vaccine targeting two relevant pathogens causing respiratory diseases 14 Similarly adenoviral vectors could be applied in this eld 15 Vaccines based on whole viruses are associated with concerns about antibodydependent enhancement of viral infection reactogenicity and strain reversion to pathogenic forms among other safety issues 16 Therefore the path for vaccine development will require a detailed characterization not only in terms of ecacy but also safety 17 Although inactivated vaccines will perhaps be the main avenue for generating the rst experimental vaccines alternative approaches should be explored in parallel namely the development of subunit vaccines Since the coronavirus spike S glycoproteins initiate entry into cells they are considered the primary target for neutralizing antibodies Figure 1 Cytotoxic Tlymphocyte CTL responses are also of key relevance to protect against viral infections 18 Under these principles vaccine Vaccines 2020 8 183 3 of 19 development against COVID19 has been initiated and eorts announced in this eld include the development of RNAbased vaccines by CureVac 1920 and an RNA vaccine candidate formulated with a novel lipid nanoparticle LNP carrying mRNA encoding for a fulllength prefusion stabilized S protein 21 Another candidate developed by Shenzhen GenoImmune Medical Institute 22 consists of a multiepitopic vaccine based on the generation of articial antigen presenting cells through transduction as a way to express viral antigens and immune modulatory genes to ultimately activate T cells Figure 1 Structure of the SARSCoV2 virus The virus is formed by an envelope membrane associated with the following structural proteins spike protein S which mediates binding to the host cell receptors and considered a critical target for the induction of antibodies capable of neutralizing the virus hemagglutininesterase dimer HE which acts as a potent mediator of attachment and destruction of sialic acid receptors on the host cell surface a membrane glycoprotein M which is important to generate the virus and the envelope protein E which adheres to the M protein to form the viral envelope The viral structure also comprises a nucleocapsid protein N that along with the RNA genome produces the nucleocapsid Although the conventional developmental paths for vaccines take several years the vaccine against hand foot and mouth disease HFMD that was approved in China demonstrates how joint eorts can lead to new vaccines that are accepted in relatively short periods after a pathogen emerges 23 Similarities with the SARSCoV1 virus constitute a valuable reference for vaccine development however it should be considered that the genetic variability of SARSCoV1 seems higher as more than two variants have been described Despite this the cross protection of SARSCoV1 and MERS experimental vaccines remains to be explored Thus far there is evidence that some SARSCo V1 neutralizing antibodies cross react with SARSCoV2 however extensive research in this regard is needed The epitopes conserved among SARSCoV1 and SARSCo V2 have been identied and proposed for vaccine development 24 The race for generating fundamental knowledge on COVID19 is leading to rapid advances which will be useful to rene vaccine design For instance Walls et al 25 reported cryoEM structures of the ectodomain trimer which will be of critical importance for designing vaccines and viral entry blockers Vaccines 2020 8 x 3 of 20 these principles vaccine development against COVID19 has been initiated and efforts announced in this field include the development of RNAbased vaccines by CureVac 1920 and an RNA vaccine candidate formulated with a novel lipid nanoparticle LNP carrying mRNA encoding for a fulllength prefusion stabilized S protein 21 Another candidate developed by Shenzhen GenoImmune Medical Institute 22 consists of a

24 The race for generating fundamental knowledge on COVID19 is leading to rapid advances which will be useful to refine vaccine design For instance Walls et al 25 reported cryoEM structures of the ectodomain trimer which will be of critical importance for designing vaccines and viral entry blockers They also found evidence of potent inhibition of SARSCoV2 entry into host cells by using murine polyclonal antibodies against SARSCoV1 which suggests that conserved S Vaccines 2020 8 183 4 of 19 They also found evidence of potent inhibition of SARSCoV2 entry into host cells by using murine polyclonal antibodies against SARSCoV1 which suggests that conserved S epitopes among these viruses are relevant for immunization and perhaps preexisting immunization models will be useful in the ght against COVID19 The characterization of other key targets for drug design has been accelerated eg the protease Xray structure has been recently described 26 Therefore these recent advances will set the basis to accelerate the development of COVID19 subunit vaccines taking into consideration the SARSCoV1 vaccine development especially the approach targeting the S protein In parallel with these advances in vaccine design dening vaccine platforms amenable for rapid and large scale production is required These must keep in mind that low cost safe and easy distribution and delivery are the required attributes to implement broad coverage of vaccination campaigns especially in the developing countries 3 Molecular Farming and the Plantbased Vaccines Technology Genetically engineered plants constitute a consolidated platform for the manufacturing of biopharmaceuticals Plants have been used over the last three decades for this purpose Thus far a diverse group of biopharmaceuticals has been functionally produced in plant systems that include antibodies vaccines growth factors and cytokines 27 Remarkably a recombinant enzyme produced in carrot cells has been already approved by the FDA for Gauchers disease treatment 28 The main advantages of plantbased platforms include the inability to replicate human pathogens diminishing the risk of contamination and making the purication process less strident use of unsophisticated bioreactors and ecient synthesis of complex proteins multimeric or glycosylated 2930 31 Approaches for Recombinant Protein Expression in Plants The current expression approaches for recombinant proteins using the plant cell as host comprise stablytransformed plants at the nuclear or chloroplast levels and transientlytransformed plants These expression modalities are summarized in Table 1 The conventional approach for expression of transgenes in plants comprises transgene insertion into the nuclear genome Currently Agrobacteriummediated transformation is the most popular method to achieve this modication since this bacterium has the ability to transfer large segments of DNA with minimal rearrangement at high eciency with low number of insertions Nonetheless the transgene is randomly inserted into the genome which often leads to positional eects that make expression levels unpredictable and interruption of endogenous genes a possibility Another limitation is the induction of silencing mechanisms that hamper productivity Nevertheless it should be considered that new technologies are emerging to cope with these limitations by providing ways to achieve sitedirected insertion through a number of mechanisms 31 Vaccines 2020 8 183 5 of 19 Table 1 Description of the expression approaches for the production of plantbased vaccines and precedents for MERSSARSCo V1 vaccines Approach Attractive Features Drawbacks MERSSARS Precedents Reference Proposed Target Antigens Stable nuclear genome transformation Inheritable antigen production allows seed bank generation posttranslational modications are performed protocols available for several species including seed crops Nonsite specic transgene insertion horizontal gene transfer is possible transgene expression aected by position eects and silencing transformation takes long time S protein multiepitope vaccines The Nterminal fragment of the SARSCoV1 S protein S1 was expressed in stably transformed tomato and lownicotine tobacco plants which induced IgA and IgG responses in mice 32 Transient nuclear genome transformation Rapid production high productivity implemented at the industrial level Seed bank can not be generated requires purication of the antigen to eliminate toxic compounds from the host and agrobacteria residues S protein multiepitope vaccines A chimeric protein of GFP and amino acids 1658 of the SARSCoV1 S protein S1 GFP was transiently expressed in tobacco leaves and stably transformed in tobacco and lettuce No immunization assays were performed The SARSCoV1 N protein was transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana which induced in mice high levels of IgG1 and IgG2 a and up regulation of IFN and IL10 in splenocytes A chimeric protein of GFP and the SARSCoV1 S protein was transiently expressed in tobacco plants No immunization tests were performed The SARSCoV1 M and N proteins were transiently expressed in N benthamiana The N protein was antigenic but immunogenicity was not assessed 3335 Transplastomic technologies High productivity multigene expression is possible improved biosafety since the transgene is inherited maternally sitespecic insertion through recombination not aected by silencing or position eects Complex posttranslational modications are not performed transformation protocols available for few species and the generation of lines takes long time Multiepitope vaccines A chimeric protein of GFP and amino acids 1658 of the SARSCoV1 S S1 GFP was expressed in transplastomic tobacco plants 3236 Vaccines 2020 8 183 6 of 19 In the case of transplastomic technologies they typically comprise the sitedirected insertion of the foreign DNA into the chloroplast genome in an event induced by homologous recombination The main advantage of this technology is the high protein yield which is a consequence of the high copy number of the transgene and the fact that silencing events have not been reported thus far and position eects are avoided due to the sitedirected insertion In addition transgene connement is achieved given the maternal inheritance shown by most plant species and several proteins can be produced from a single transformation event through the use of operonlike arrangements 3738 For more information regarding transplastomic technologies readers are referred to reviews published by 3639 Another approach to express heterologous protein in plants relies on the use of viralbased vectors which exploit the ecient promoters UTRs and DNARNA replication mechanisms found in plant viruses Interestingly the Agrobacteriummediated delivery of viral vectors has consolidated as a highly ecient strategy to achieve rapid production of biopharmaceuticals with yield up to 5 g of protein per kg of fresh plant biomass The tobamoviruses potexviruses tobraviruses geminiviruses and comoviruses have served as a basis for the development of transient ecient expression systems in plants 40 This technology however demands the purication of the target protein given the presence of toxic compounds eg alkaloids in the typical host Nicotiana benthamiana as well as bacterial residues especially endotoxins Therefore at present this technology is applied for the formulation of injectable or nasal vaccines 32 Current Scenario of PlantBased Vaccines Thus far some plantvaccine candidates have entered clinical trials including candidates against swine inuenza rabies and hepatitis B 41 The most promising candidates are the inuenza vaccines developed by Medicago Inc that rely on using a nonreplicative vector carrying viral regulatory sequences to mediate the transient expression of Hemagglutinin HA in N benthamiana which has led to injectable vaccine candidates 4243 Overall these vaccines have been seen as safe and their immunogenic properties have been positively evaluated using in vitro assays with human and mice cells The trials conducted in volunteers revealed proper immunogenicity with no serious adverse eects see Table 2 Moreover a group of respiratory diseases has been targeted through the plantbased production of antigens with promising immunogenicity in preclinical trials 44 Table 2 Vaccines against inuenza based on plantmade VirusLike Particles VLPs evaluated in vitro or in mice and humans VLPs Produced and Immunization Approach Findings Reference Haemagglutinin HA from H1N1 ACalifornia072009 pdmH1N1 Mice were immunized twice by the intramuscular im route or by combining i m priming and intranasal in boosting HA from strains ACalifornia072009 H1N1 H1 Cal AVictoria36111 H3N2 H3 Vic BBrisbane6008 BBris Victoria lineage and BMassachusetts022012 BMass Yamagata lineage In a Phase II clinical trial subjects were immunized with a single im dose using Alhydrogel as an adjuvant VLP inuenza vaccination exhibited high levels of antibodies titers compared to the inactivated inuenza vaccine IIV Lung homogenate displayed chemokinecytokine levels and virus loads lower in the VLP groups compared to the IIV group Both homologous and heterologous antigenspecic CD4 T cells were elicited Additionally production of IFN IL2 andor TNF was achieved upon ex vivo antigenic restimulation 45 46 Vaccines 2020 8 183 7 of 19 VLPs Produced and Immunization Approach Findings Reference Table 2 Cont HA from ACalifornia072009 H1N1 VLPs were evaluated in vitro using human monocytederived macrophages HA from AH1N1 California0709 pdm H1N1 The inactivated H1N1 vaccine IIV was included as a reference vaccine Mice were imimmunized twice HA from ACalifornia709 H1N1 and AIndonesia505 H5N1 In vitro assays were performed using mouse and human DCs Mice were immunized by the im route using Alhydrogel as an adjuvant HA from ACalifornia72009 or AIndonesia505 strains In vitro assays were performed using mouse dendritic cells The plantmade VLPs were eciently captured and subjected to endosomal processing and crosspresentation CD4 TNF IFN and CD8 IFN T cell responses were higher for the plantmade vaccine than the IIV formulation The plantmade VLP vaccine elicited stronger and more balanced immune responses than IIV Human DCs exposed to plantmade VLPs showed high stimulation in terms of secretion of IL6 IL10 and TNF and CD83 expression along with activation of CD4 and CD8 T cells VLPs induced accumulation of both c DC1s and c DC2 in the draining lymph nodes of test mice Lymphocytes from mice immunized with plantmade VLPs secreted higher concentrations of proinammatory cytokines including IL12 IL6 and TNF upon antigenic stimulation The plantmade VLPs trimmers were morphologically stable over time and interacted with activated antigenpresenting cells similar to the wild type virus 47 48 49 50 Nonetheless the ultimate goal for lowcost vaccine development could be achieved by generating oral formulations not requiring purication and being composed of freezedried biomass encapsulated in gelatin pills or tablets Under this focus the goal is to trigger specic immune responses via the gutassociated lymphoid tissues GALT For this purpose edible plants lacking toxic metabolites should be used Perhaps the main disadvantage of this technology is the long time required to generate transformed lines of edible crops eciently expressing the antigen of interest eg rice or corn transgenic lines or transplastomic lines 51 These oral vaccines will overcome the disadvantages of injectable vaccines such as painful administration and the risk associated with invasive delivery routes In terms of costs avoiding the requirements of sterile devices and trained personnel represent substantial savings The fact that plantbased vaccine formulations will not require antigen purication will be without a doubt the main factor that will make them lowcost alternatives 52 which is necessary to provide wide vaccination coverage in developing and lowincome countries Recent promising reports in the viability of formulating oral vaccines include the case of the Hepatitis B virus surface antigen 53 and models of immunotherapy against allergy with promising results 54 among other diseases Therefore plantbased vaccines are becoming a reality although it should be recognized that the progress has been slower than initially expected This is particularly true for the development of oral vaccines with the main drawbacks being poor characterization of antigen stability bioavailability and reproducibility 5155 The currently available expression strategies for foreign proteins in plants allow projecting the generation of several vaccine candidates against COVID19 in the short term The expression approach Vaccines 2020 8 183 8 of 19 and targeted organelle will depend on the nature of the selected target antigen In the following section possible avenues for the development of plantbased vaccines are envisaged Table 3 and Figure 2 Figure 2 Developmental paths for plantbased vaccines Vaccine antigens can comprise full length viral proteins or chimeric proteins rationally designed to serve as multiepitopic vaccines This is based on the selection of T cell and B cell epitopes with the aid of immune bioinformatics tools and experimental data of their protective capacity Current genetic engineering technologies allow expressing target antigens either stably or transiently which allow exploring distinct immunization approaches Transient expression typically requires purication of the antigenwhich is useful for the formulation of injectable vaccineswhereas stable transformation especially in edible crops allows implementing oral immunization schemes without purication Combined schemes using pure antigens for priming by parenteral administration and plant biomass containing the antigen for oral boosting are likely ideal approaches capable of inducing longterm protection in several compartments especially in mucous membranes Table 3 Summary of antigen

Possibilities to Develop AntiCOVID19 Plantbased Vaccines 41 VirusLike Particles VLPs One prominent approach for vaccine design is based on the use of viruslike particles VLPs which are macromolecular complexes resembling viruses but lacking their genome In this way VLP s mimic the native structure of viruses but are not infective This avoids the disadvantages of Vaccines 2020 8 x 3 of 20 The currently available expression strategies for foreign proteins in plants allow projecting the generation of several vaccine candidates against COVID19 in the short term The expression approach and

large number of ELP moieties are included 60 Vaccines 2020 8 183 9 of 19 vaccines formulated with attenuated or inactivated viruses that include reactogenicity and reversion to pathogenic forms 6162 A myriad of reports on the production of VLPs can be found in the literature that comprise the cases of the inuenza virus human papillomavirus human immunodeciency virus foot and mouth disease virus Norwalk virus rift valley fever virus and hepatitis B virus 6164 The precedents of SARSCoV1 and MERS antigens expressed in recombinant systems leading to the formation of VLPs constitute important guides for the topic of COVID19 vaccine development Mortola and Roy 2004 produced coronavirus VLPs applying baculovirusinsect cells expression Sf9 cells which was based on the following structural proteins S spike E envelope M membrane and N nucleocapsid of SARSCoV either individually or simultaneously Simultaneous expression at high levels was achieved for S E and M proteins leading to an ecient VLPs assembly and release evidenced by electron microscopy and immunouorescence The authors demonstrated that the formed VLPs were similar in morphology to the SARSCo V1 virions 65 Another group reported in the same year that M and E proteins were sucient for the ecient formation of VLPs in insect cells 66 In 2007 the immunogenicity of SARSCoV1 VLPs was rst described by evaluating insect cellmade VLPs based on the M E and S proteins Electron microscopy demonstrated VLPs formation in coinfected insect cells Mice subjected to an immunization scheme consisting of four subcutaneous sc doses of VLPs emulsied with Freunds adjuvant showed high antibody titers against SARS CoV Furthermore VLPs elicited cellular immunity following increased production of IFN and IL4 67 Subsequent in vitro assays using VLPs designed with the batisolated coronavirus protein S and the SARSCoV1 proteins E and M demonstrated ability to stimulate DCs in terms of cytokine induction evidenced by IL6 and TNFalpha production Furthermore the study indicated that IFN and IL4 CD4 T cells increased in coculture with DCs preexposed to the VLPs tested 68 Given that immunization by mucosal routes is the most pertinent for vaccination SARSCo V1 VLPs were analyzed in a mouse model based on intraperitoneal or nasal immunization Both routes led to SARSCoV1specic IgG responses IgG levels in the groups immunized intraperitoneally were higher Nasal immunization usually results in the induction of secretory IgA responses at the genital tract saliva and lungs a type of response that is not eciently induced by systemic In the mentioned study IgA production at the intestinal tract was higher for administration intraperitoneal administration when compared to intranasal administration however only genital tract secretions from the inimmunized group showed neutralization activity 69 Another approach for the production of VLPs consisted in coexpressing the SARSCoV1 S protein and the M1 inuenza protein in the baculovirusinsect cell expression system Interestingly the chimeric VLPs showed similar size and morphology compared to the wild type SARSCoV1 Immunogenicity and protective ecacy of these chimeric VLPs were tested in a mouse lethal challenge model Complete protection from death was observed in mice vaccinated intramuscularly or intranasally with the chimeric VLPs which contained 08 g of the SARSCoV1 protein S 70 In the case of the Middle East respiratory syndrome MERS VLPs with proteins S E and M were generated using the baculovirusinsect cell expression system by Wang et al 2017 71 Electron microscopy and immunoelectron microscopy revealed high structural similarity between the MERSCoV VLPs and the native virus Rhesus macaques inoculated with MERSCoV VLPs and aluminum adjuvant showed nal virus neutralizing antibody titers reaching 11280 inducing Thelper 1 Th1 cellmediated immunity In a more recent study the structural proteins of MERSCoV were expressed in silkworm larvae and B m 5 cells for the development of vaccine candidates However protein S was not detected in the form of VLPs despite the fact that E and M proteins were secreted to the culture supernatant Surfactant treatment and mechanical extrusion using protein S or Bm5 cells expressing structural proteins allowed producing nanovesicles exhibiting protein S with a diameter ranging from 100 to 200 nm as revealed by immunoTEM 72 Vaccines 2020 8 183 10 of 19 Although insect cells possess a protein processing capacity similar to that of higher eukaryotic cells the protein processing pathways are not totally equivalent 73 In terms of Nacetylglycosylation insect cells have the ability to assemble Nglycans to a nascent polypeptide However they have unusual nal processing activity mediated by Nacetylglucosaminidase soluble or membranebound form which trims an intermediate product common to mammalian and insect pathways resulting in the insectspecic paucimannose as a nal product that avoids the galactosylation process occurring in mammals 74 Considering that VLPs of enveloped viruses have been successfully expressed in plants by expressing the HA protein it is anticipated that SARSCoV2 VLPs could be assembled by expressing the S protein In fact although not published in the literature yet Medicago has described the generation of VLPs in plants 75 For this purpose nuclear expression targeting the transGolgi secretion route is proposed to yield a protein subjected to the glycosylation and secretion machinery that could make possible the production of VLPs 76 Therefore adoption of these works would be valuable during the development of COVID19 plantbased vaccines see the section below Besides VLPs resembling the SARSCoV2 virus another possible approach is to adopt SARSCoV2 epitopes and express them in chimeric VLPs In this way a VLP from an unrelated virus can serve as the scaold to present the target SARSCo V2 epitopes For this purpose the hepatitis B core protein has been applied as scaold to display unrelated antigens of some pathogens In particular this has been applied at the immunodominant ce1 loop region which allows displaying the target on the spike structures of the VLPs 77 A recent review revealed that at least 97 vaccine candidates have been developed based on plant viruses covering infectious agents cancer and autoimmune disorders 78 The glycosylation patterns of proteins that form VLPs can impact their immunogenicity and protective capacity Interestingly glycoengineering strategies have been successfully implemented for plants which allows diversifying their application as hosts for the production of biopharmaceuticals This is a relevant aspect considering that plants lack the ability to perform glycosylation which is a characteristic of mammalian systems For instance plants perform beta12 xylosylation core alpha13 fucosylation and the addition of a second Nacetylglucosamine GlcNAc to the mannose core Moreover plant glycans lack 14 galactose and sialic acid as well as biantennary Nglycans 79 In some cases such as antibody production these dierences on glycosylation can be associated to adverse eects that include generation of immunogenic activity which can eventually lead to blocking antibodies against the therapeutic antibody Nonetheless in the case of vaccines these dierences could add more immunogenic potential and improve vaccine ecacy 80 In any case it is of interest to comment that glycoengineering has allowed developing knock down N benthamiana plants for beta12 x ylosyltransferase XylT and alpha13 fucosyltransferase FucT genes which showed signicant reduction in the production of xylosylated andor core alpha13 fucosylated proteins with no phenotypic alterations 81 These lines will be valuable tools to study the impact of glycosylation in the ecacy of COVID19 VLPs which will allow optimizing the plantbased vaccines 42 Multiepitopic Vaccines Another approach that deserves attention is the development of multiepitopic vaccines which oers the opportunity of achieving a ne rational vaccine design by selecting epitopes that potentially induce robust and protective immune responses At the same time this approach will discard those related to nonprotective responses or even those inducing antibodydependent enhancement of the disease In this way a highly ecacious and safe vaccine can be obtained Of special interest are the reports proving that specic S protein epitopes enhance the disease upon a pathogen challenge which highlights the relevance of recurring to the rational design of vaccines to ensure not only immunoprotection but safety 82 For the case of multiepitope vaccines against infectious agents several reports have focused on selecting the most promising Th B cell and T cell epitopes that might allow the rational design of a vaccine inducing robust protective responses while at the same time avoiding deleterious or Vaccines 2020 8 183 11 of 19 nonrelevant responses One key factor that adds importance to the development of multiepitopic vaccines against viral disease is genetic variability In fact it has been suggested that the SARSCoV2 virus evolved into two major types L and S The L type 70 predominates versus the S type 30 with the latter being proposed as the ancestral version The L type is more aggressive than the S type and the analysis performed by Tang et al 83 suggests that human interference inuenced the prevalence of L and S types right after the outbreak appearance Another study has also suggested a rapid evolution of this coronavirus 84 Therefore the design of multiepitopic vaccines must adopt the selection of epitopes conserved among the viral variants with the capacity to induce neutralizing humoral responses as critical criterion It should also be considered that CTL responses are relevant to cope with COVID19 85 The selected epitopes are the targets to which adaptive immune responses should be induced but they lack the required complexity to trigger robust immune responses Therefore a carrier is required to increase antigen complexity and through adjuvant eects enhance potency of the induced immune response making it properly polarized Among these carriers the B subunit of the cholera toxin and the heatlabile enterotoxin from Escherichia coli have been extensively used to carry unrelated antigens The main advantage of these molecules is their adjuvant eects at the mucosal levels as well as their ability to eciently deliver the antigens to the submucosa thanks to a mechanism of translocation mediated by binding to the GM1 receptor at the epithelial cells in the mucosal surfaces 86 Once at the submucosa the antigen is eciently captured and processed by antigen presenting cells which subsequently induce robust mucosal and systemic Th1 immune responses at the lymph nodes The design of LTBCTBbased chimeras carrying SARSCo V2 epitopes is an interesting approach that should be explored Prolinecontaining linkers have been used to properly display unrelated antigens without altering the ability of those carriers to form the pentameric structure responsible for GM1 binding 57 The accumulation of those chimeric proteins in the ER is advisable although toxicity has been reported for some plants accumulating high levels of those recombinant proteins 87 Given that plant systems have been successfully adopted for the production of multiepitope proteins the generation of such vaccines against COVID19 is considered highly viable 8890 Besides expressing chimeric proteins multiple antigen expression can be achieved by transplastomic technologies operonlike expression or at the nuclear level using the picornaviral 2A sequence that allows releasing individual antigens from a single coding gene 91 43 Immune Complexes The production of immune complexes ICs in plants is another approach that renders highly immunogenic agents ICs consist of antigens complexed to antibodies recognizing them constituting macromolecular entities that are eciently captured and processed by antigen presenting cells 92 This results in the induction of robust humoral and cellmediated immune responses 5993 Taking advantage of the machinery of plant cells for protein synthesis and processing they have been exploited as antibodies and IC s factories 94 For instance IC s based on the tetanus toxin fragment C fused to a monoclonal antibody were produced in transgenic tobacco plants These ICs were highly immunogenic inducing immunoprotective eects when administered without accessory adjuvants by the sc subcutaneous route in mice 95 This approach has also been applied to the case of the Ag85B and Acr antigens from Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the GP1 antigen from the Ebola virus 9697 Perhaps the main disadvantage of this approach is the requirement of dened antibodies targeting the antigen which is not available yet for SARSCoV2 However it should be considered that the cross reactivity of antiSARSCoV1 S protein antibodies with the counterpart of SARSCoV2 has been reported 3 44 ElastinLike Polypeptide Fusions The purication of antigens is a laborious and expensive activity as part of the production of injectable vaccines 97 One alternative to simplify purication relies on the fusion of elastinlike Vaccines 2020 8 183 12 of 19 polypeptides ELP that possess a unique property named reversible phase transition which allows precipitating the protein of interest by changing the temperature This approach is an alternative to the complexexpensive anity chromatography 98 that has been applied to develop plantbased vaccines candidates with relevant ndings For instance the M tuberculosis antigens Ag 85B and ESAT6 were fused to ELP and expressed in transgenic tobacco 99 and the plantmade antigens were subcutaneously scadministered to mice and able to trigger longlasting humoral immune responses The ELP did not negatively impact the immunogenic properties of the antigens The haemagglutinin HA antigen from the inuenza virus has also been expressed under this modality in tobacco where antigen purication was simplied and the obtained product induced neutralizing antibodies in mice after two sc immunizations ELPylation did not alter the immunogenicity of HA 99 Therefore these precedents suggest that the ELP technology is a possible approach to be explored for the production of antigens against the SARSCo V2 virus The common steps to the abovementioned antigen design will comprise determining antigen yields and antigenic activity assessing the immunogenic activity in test animals under distinct administration routes and validating the safety and stability of the vaccine The latter will be critical to justify the application and get approval to conduct clinical trials 5 Eorts to Develop PlantBased Vaccines against MERS and SARSCoV1 A key precedent for this eld is the vaccine candidates already reported for SARSCoV1 and MERS which are both closely related to SARSCoV2 Following nuclear expression approaches the Nterminal fragment of the SARSCoV1 S protein S1 was expressed in tomato and lownicotine tobacco plants using an Agrobacteriummediated method Mice orally immunized with this transgenic tomato revealed signicantly increased levels of SARSCoV1specic IgA Sera of mice parenterally primed with the transgenic tobacco showed the presence of antiSARSCoV1 IgG 32 Another study focused on expressing a chimeric protein of GFP and amino acids 1658 of the SARSCoV1 spike protein S1 GFP by using tobacco leaves subjected to transient expression After microscopy localization the fusion protein was observed in the cytosol and the periphery of the nucleus Stable transgenic tobacco and lettuce plants were generated by Agrobacteriummediated transformation The expression of the chimeric antigen was also achieved in tobacco chloroplasts However no immunization assays were performed 33100 The SARSCoV1 nucleocapsid r N protein of 423 aa was transiently expressed in N benthamiana Yields reached up to 79 gg of leaf fresh weight corresponding to 081 of the Total Soluble protein TSP at 3 dpi under silencing suppression conditions p 19 Mice immunization revealed that three doses led to eective Bcell maturation and dierentiation achieving high levels of IgG1 and IgG2 a IFN and IL10 were upregulated in splenocytes while the expression of IL2 and IL4 was not 33 The nucleocapsid protein N and the membrane protein M were transiently expressed in N benthamiana Yields reached up to 34 gg fresh leaf weight 02 TSP for the N protein while the M protein yields were 01015 TSP The puried N protein reacted with human sera having Nspecic antibodies No immunization assays were performed 35 These studies constitute a valuable guide to select the most convenient expression platforms for specic SARSCoV2 antigens 6 Relevance of Mucosal Vaccines and PrimeBoosting Immunization Schemes Although most of the vaccines against respiratory diseases are administered by parenteral routes it should be recognized that immune proles deserve improvements especially in terms of immunogenicity and ecacy in the elderly 101 Mucosal vaccines especially intranasaladministered vaccines are a promise for immunization against respiratory diseases given the protections induced in lungs and other mucosal tissues that are critical ports for pathogen entry Critical alternatives for the development of mucosal vaccines include guaranteeing antigen delivery and immunostimulating capacity at the mucosa while at the same time being minimally reactogenictoxic Among the Vaccines 2020 8 183 13 of 19 immunopotentiator molecules that can be explored are bacterial toxin derivatives tolllike receptor ligands and cytokines 102103 Although some companies have already started the production of plantbased VLPs vaccines 75104 using transient expression systems these eorts are mainly directed to developing injectable vaccines Therefore it is imperative to start developing alternatives related to mucosal immunization For this purpose generating plants stably expressing SARSCoV2 antigens will open new avenues for the exploitation of this technology This approach will result in the production of edible plant material containing SARSCoV2 antigens that could be used for the development of oral boosting agents Interestingly this concept has been assessed by some groups with relevant results In the case of a vaccine targeting the hepatitis B virus a scheme comprising intramuscular i m boosting with the pure HBs Ag antigen followed by double oral boosting with plant material containing HBs Ag at six week intervals led to a comparable response to that induced by the standard intramuscular im vaccination scheme 53 Moreover in the case of poliomyelitis vaccination a plantbased vaccine based on transplastomic plants expressing the VP1 antigen fused to a carrier has been assessed as oral boosting agents after priming with the inactivated polio vaccine administered subcutaneously Boosting with the plantmade VP1 based antigen signicantly enhanced VP1 IgG1 and VP1 IgA titers when compared to the response in animals not receiving boosts The scheme also allowed inducing neutralizing antibodies for the three poliovirus Sabin serotypes when two doses of IPV and plantcell oral boosts were administered whereas a single dose of IPV resulted in low neutralization potential 105 In this way freezedried plant material can be used as a lowcost vaccine rendering thermostability and easy to administer features Similarly pure antigens produced in plants have been assessed with promising results in schemes where a conventional vaccine is used as a priming agent and the plantmade antigen is administered by the oral route as boosting 106 Exploring these schemes will be useful to achieve the best immune prole against SARSCoV2 in terms of safe and longlasting protective immune responses In fact the potential of using primeboosting schemes through dierent immunization routes has been proven as an ecacious approach to achieve the desired immune proles 107 7 Conclusions The emergence of COVID19 has led to a global emergency that demands the development of new biologics especially vaccines to counteract against this threat In this scenario a plantmade vaccine is a viable approach to rapidly respond to this need The current expression technologies oer relevant paths for developing antiCOVID19 vaccines VLPs constitute an attractive approach for the development of ecient and safe vaccines which is associated with high immunogenicity preservation of the antigenic determinants and lack of replicative capacity Thus VLPs based on the main SARSCoV2 structural proteins is an attractive approach for vaccine development against coronavirus infections The transient expression systems based on deconstructed viral vectors and N benthamiana as host will allow for immediate exploitation of plants as ecient biofactories of injectable vaccine candidates which are expected to be implemented and entered into clinical trials in a year The development of vaccines based on transplastomic lines or edible plant species transformed at the nuclear level and intended to result in oral vaccines especially boosting agents to provide mucosal immunity are considered long term goals However they have special importance given their low cost and potential to serve as eective boosting agents which could lead to attractive immune proles characterized by proper humoral response in the mucosal compartments and longlasting protection especially for the elderly In parallel to these developments the production of monoclonal antibodies in plants will provide another strategy to generate alternatives to the convalescent plasma transfusion in which plantmade antibodies will constitute a low cost and safer intravenous treatment for critically ill patients Perhaps the main challenge envisioned for the development of COVID19 plantbased vaccines will be as is typical for all vaccines testing their ecacy in large clinical trials to validate their Vaccines 2020 8 183 14 of 19 safety while fullling the requirements of regulatory agencies The fact that there are precedents of a plantmade biopharmaceutical approved for human use and plantmade vaccines against inuenza under clinical trials with promising safety and ecacy is encouraging Therefore plantbased vaccines have a realistic potential to contribute to the ght against COVID19 As the COVID19 epidemic advances the exploitation of plantmade vaccines is a promise to generate low cost easy to administer and safeeective vaccines to ght against this pandemic The next few months will be critical to envision the real potential of this technology Author Contributions Writingoriginal draft preparation SRM VAME RNG and JIAV review and editing OGO editing of tables and gures VAME and SRM
