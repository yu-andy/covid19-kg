de Imagem Cardiotorcica Departamento de Diagnstico por Imagem Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein So Paulo SP Brasil ABSTRACT The disease caused by the new coronavirus SARSCoV2 designated COVID19 emerged in late 2019 in China in the city of Wuhan Hubei province and showed exponential growth in that country It subsequently spread to all continents and infection with SARSCoV2 is now classified as a pandemic Given the magnitude achieved scientific interest in COVID19 has also grown in the international literature including its manifestations on imaging studies particularly on CT To date no case series have been published in Brazil Therefore our objective was to describe the CT findings in an initial series of 12 patients Keywords Coronavirus infections Coronavirus Multidetector computed tomography In late 2019 a new coronavirussevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCo V2was identified as the causative agent of an outbreak of pneumonia in China in the city of Wuhan Hubei province An association was found between the first cases and a local food market that sold live animals where most of such patients had been on business or visiting of COVID19 have been in areas where widespread transmission has been documented or have had potential exposure due to participation in events or have been in places where cases of COVID19 have been reported Among the most commonly reported clinical manifestations of COVID19 are fever fatigue dry cough anorexia myalgia dyspnea and sputum production 7 The spread of the new coronavirus was rapid resulting in an epidemic with the main form of transmission being persontoperson either via the airways or by touching contaminated surfaces and then the eyes nose or mouth The epidemic hit other continents and the disease was called coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 New cases started being reported in other countries initially in individuals who had travelled to China and in people who had had contact with them and outbreaks related to local transmission were subsequently documented 14 COVID19 is currently considered a pandemic The spectrum of clinical presentation of COVID19 is wide ranging from absence of symptoms to critical disease Most respiratory infections are mild but severe or critical forms have been also described especially in the elderly and individuals with comorbidities who can present with dyspnea hypoxemia extensive pulmonary involvement on imaging studies respiratory failure shock and multiple organ failure The estimated COVID19 mortality in China was 23 most cases having occurred in elderly patients or patients with comorbidities cardiovascular disease diabetes mellitus chronic lung disease hypertension and cancer5 However the reported mortality rates vary in different populations in Italy for example where the mean age of the affected population is higher the currently reported mortality rate is approximately 586 The possibility of COVID19 should be considered in symptomatic patients who in the past 14 days have had close contact with a suspected or confirmed case The diagnosis of COVID19 is confirmed through detection of SARSCoV2 RNA by reversetranscriptase polymerase chain reaction RTPCR from nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab samples However if RTPCR is negative and clinical suspicion is high the recommendation is that RTPCR testing be performed again including on swabs from other respiratory sites It is also worth highlighting the value of testing for other viruses that can clinically present in a similar way Multiple articles have been published reporting CT findings in COVID19 even in patients with negative RTPCR results arousing interest in the role of CT in the current clinical scenario The American College of Radiology and the Brazilian College of Radiology recommend that chest CT be used in hospitalized patients with pneumonia symptoms and with specific clinical indications for CT it is important to point out that neither of them recommend using CT for screening of COVID19 or as the test of choice for diagnosing COVID 1989 Chest CT can help in the diagnosis of COVID19 but it can not confirm or exclude it alone When RTPCR is used as a reference chest CT has high sensitivity 97 but low specificity 25 given the overlap of findings with those of respiratory infections of different etiologies 10 The most commonly observed CT findings in cases of COVID19 are pulmonary groundglass opacities and occasionally consolidations with a predominantly peripheral distribution sometimes associated with fine reticulation forming the crazypaving pattern vascular Correspondence to Rodrigo Caruso Chate Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein Avenida Albert Einstein 627701 CEP 05652900 So Paulo SP Brasil Tel 55 11 21512452 Email

experience in Brazil thickening and the reversed halo sign Central parenchymal involvement or the presence of nodules cavitation lymph node enlargement or pleural effusion are less common1113 It has been suggested that the reversed halo sign described by some authors indicates that organizing pneumonia might be one of the mechanisms of lung injury1415 The objective of the present study was to describe the major CT findings in the first case series of COVID19 in Brazil In this initial experience in Brazil involving the first 12 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID19 based on RTPCR results who underwent chest CT at our facility the following CT features were observed groundglass opacities in 12 patients 100 crazy paving pattern in 7 58 alveolar consolidation in 4 33 reversed halo sign in 1 8 and pleural effusion in 1 8 Nodules cavitation and lymph node enlargement were not identified in our sample We observed involvement of both lungs in 11 patients 92 and a peripheral predominance in 9 patients 75 the changes affected mainly the lower lobes in 8 patients 67 were multilobar and relatively diffuse in 3 patients 25 and predominated in the left lower lobe in 1 patient 8 Figure 1 illustrates a typical case and demonstrates the evolution of the findings whereas Figure 2 demonstrates not only the major changes caused by the disease but also another possible but relatively uncommon finding small pleural effusion this type of opacity is low However of course chest Xrays can be useful in monitoring inpatients including those who are in the ICU because it is a widely available rapid and inexpensive test that enables more frequent often daily monitoring of the extent of the pulmonary involvement in the disease It has been demonstrated that asymptomatic individuals can present with pulmonary findings clinicalradiological dissociation but less frequently than do symptomatic patients and in general with less extensive involvement and predominant ground glass opacities In contrast symptomatic patients more commonly present with pulmonary findings with predominant consolidations and more extensive parenchymal involvement 16 Despite the variety of presentations it has generally been reported that in the first 4 days after symptom onset the groundglass opacity pattern predominates Between days 5 and 8 after symptom onset there is an increase in the extent of the pulmonary involvement with the presence of crazypaving pattern and consolidations Between days 9 and 13 after symptom onset when CT findings are usually at their peak consolidations are noted to predominate after day 14 the process of consolidation resorption begins and the crazypaving pattern tends to resolve although groundglass opacities may persist17 The resolution of the findings is usually relatively slow taking approximately 30 days and scarring changes in the lung parenchyma have been described Because the major imaging finding in COVID19 is groundglass opacities chest Xray plays a less important role in the imaging evaluation of patients given that the sensitivity of chest Xrays for detecting The major CT features identified in the first 12 Brazilian patients evaluated at our facility are very similar to those being described in the literature and fundamentally include bilateral multifocal groundglass A C B D Figure 1 Axial images in A to C and coronal reconstructions in D of chest CT scans of a 44 yearold man with clinical findings suggestive of COVID19 fever sore throat and frequent dry cough demonstrating the most commonly described pattern numerous bilateral multifocal groundglass opacities associated with fine reticulation and interlobular septal thickening crazypaving pattern involving various lung lobes and being predominantly peripheral in distribution in the parenchyma and a little more extensive in the posterior regions of the lower lobes The patient had a positive RTPCR result for COVID19 on the day he underwent the first CT scan images on the left in each pair and was hospitalized A second CT scan which was performed three days later images on the right in each pair because he continued to have fever spikes and dry cough demonstrated an increase in the number and extent of pulmonary opacities 24 J Bras Pneumol 2020462e20200121 Chate RC Fonseca EKUN Passos RBD Teles GBS Shoji H Szarf G A D B E C F Figure 2 Chest CT scans of different patients illustrating the spectrum of findings of COVID19 in our sample In A a 61 yearold male patient with peripheral and posterior groundglass opacities in the lower lobes blue arrows in the right lower lobe as well as a focus of parenchymal opacification in the lingula In B and C a 41 yearold male patient with extensive groundglass opacities associated with septal thickening and fine reticulation crazypaving in the right upper lobe in addition to other small scattered foci in the upper and lower left lobes In D an 85 yearold male patient with groundglass opacities associated with fine reticulation and thickening of some interlobular septa extending mostly into the periphery of the left lower lobe but also present in the lingula and in the right lower lobe In E and F a 42 yearold male patient with groundglass opacities and bilateral foci of consolidation predominantly in the most posterior regions of the lower lobes The patient also had bilateral minimal pleural effusion arrows a relatively uncommon finding in patients with COVID19 In addition signs suggestive of hepatic steatosis were identified opacities sometimes associated with fine reticulation and septal thickening crazypaving pattern in general involving several lung lobes and being predominantly peripheral in distribution in the parenchyma The low incidence of pleural effusion and the absence of other findings such as lymph node enlargement nodules and cavitary lesions are in line with recent international experience s 1017 The most common CT findings in COVID19 overlap with those observed in pulmonary infections caused by other agents particularly other viruses and ideally the definitive diagnosis of COVID19 should be based on RTPCR results Nevertheless given the magnitude achieved by COVID19 in recent months with the disease being classified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization it is essential that clinicians and radiologists be familiar with the most common imaging presentations of COVID19 as well as with the expected evolution of the findings so that they can contribute to earlier identification of cases and thus to reducing the consequences and mortality of the disease REFERENCES 1 National Health Commission of the Peoples Republic of China homepage on the Internet Beijing The Commission c 2020 updated 2020 Jan 23 cited 2020
