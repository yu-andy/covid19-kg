recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 caused by SARSCoV2 in December 2019 raised global health concerns The viral 3 chymotrypsinlike cysteine protease 3 CLpro enzyme controls coronavirus replication and is essential for it s life cycle 3 CLpro is a proven drug discovery target in the case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARSCoV and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus MERSCoV Recent studies revealed that the genome sequence of SARSCoV2 is very similar to that of SARSCoV Therefore herein we analysed the 3 CLpro sequence constructed its 3 D homology model and screened it against a medicinal plant library containing 32297 potential antiviral phytochemicalstraditional Chinese medicinal compounds Our analyses revealed that the top nine hits might serve as potential anti SARSCoV2 lead molecules for further optimisation and drug development process to combat COVID19 Keywords Coronavirus SARSCoV2 COVID19 Natural products Protein homology modelling

novel coronavirus was reported on December 30 2019 in Wuhan city Hubei province PR China 1 Swift actions were taken by the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention CDC Chinese health authorities and researchers The World Health Organization WHO temporarily named this pathogen 2019 novel coronavirus 2019 n CoV 2 On January 10 2020 the first wholegenome sequence of 2019 nCoV was released which helped researchers to quickly identify the virus in patients using reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction RTPCR methods 3 On January 21 the first article related to 2019 nCoV was published which revealed that 2019 nCoV belongs to the betacoronavirus group sharing ancestry with bat coronavirus HKU91 similar to SARScoronaviruses and despite sequence diversity it s spike protein interacts strongly with the human ACE2 receptor 1 On January 30 the WHO announced a Public Health Emergency of International Concern PHEIC for the 2019 nCoV outbreak Later the humantohuman transmission was confirmed As of January 31 51 wholegenome sequences of 2019 nCoV from different laboratories and regions have been submitted to GISAID database 4 On the February 12th the WHO permanently named the 2019 nCoV pathogen as SARSCoV2 and the causing disease as coronavirus disease 2019 COVID2019 Chinese government swift actions helped them to control COVID19 in China However SARSCoV2 quickly spread to over 150 countries On March 11th WHO formally recognized the COVID19 as a pandemic By March 19th 2020 the global death toll reached to 9913 with 242650 laboratoryconfirmed cases The case fatality rate among infected people is varying in different countries However global case fatality rate is presently around 392 calculated as deaths deaths laboratory confirmed cases 2 Coronaviruses are singlestranded positivesense RNA viruses that possess large viral RNA genomes 5 Recent studies showed that SARSCoV2 has a similar genomic organization to other betacoronaviruses consisting of a 5 untranslated region UTR a replicase complex orf1 ab encoding nonstructural proteins nsps a spike protein S gene envelope protein E gene a membrane protein M gene a nucleocapsid protein N gene 3 UTR and several unidentified nonstructural open reading frames 3 Although SARSCoV2 is classified into the betacoronaviruses group it is diverse from MERSCoV and SARSCoV Recent studies highlighted that SARSCoV2 genes share 80 nucleotide identity and 8910 nucleotide similarity with SARSCoV genes 6 7 Usually betacoronaviruses produce a 800 k Da polypeptide upon transcription of the genome This polypeptide is proteolytically cleaved to generate various proteins The proteolytic processing is mediated by papainlike protease PLpro and 3 chymotrypsinlike protease 3 CLpro The 3 C Lpro cleaves the polyprotein at 11 distinct sites to generate various nonstructural proteins that are important for viral replication 8 3 C Lpro play a critical role in the replication of virus particles and unlike structuralaccessory proteinencoding genes it is located at the 3 end which exhibits excessive variability Therefore it is a potential target for anticoronaviruses inhibitors screening 9 Structurebased activity analyses and high throughput studies have identified potential inhibitors for SARSCoV and MERSCoV 3 CLpro 1012 Medicinal plants especially those employed in traditional Chinese medicine have attracted significant attention because they include bioactive compounds that could be used to develop formal drugs against several diseases with no or minimal sideeffects 13 Therefore the present study was conducted to obtain structural insight into the SARSCo V2 3 CLpro and to discover potent antiCOVID19 natural compounds 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 3

downloaded from GISAID database accession numbers and details are given in Table S1 4 The genome sequence of BetaCoVKanagawa12020 GSAID EPIISL402126 was incomplete and the genome sequence of BetaCoVbatYunnanRaTG132013 EPIISL402131 was an old sequence 2013 therefore these sequences were not included in our analyses Gene sequences of 3 C Lpro were extracted from the wholegenome sequences and translated into protein sequences using the translate tool of the ExPASy server 14 The first SARSCoV2 sequence Wuhan Hu1 GSAID EPIISL402125 was used as a reference in our analysis 22 Sequence analyses In order to identify similar sequences and keyconserved residues and to infer phylogeny multiple sequence alignment of SARSCoV2 3 CLpro followed by phylogenetic tree analyses were performed using TCoffee 15 and the alignment figure was generated using ESPript 3 16 Physicochemical parameters of SARSCoV2 3C Lpro including isoelectric point instability index grand average of hydropathicity GRAVY and amino acid and atomic composition were investigated using the ProtParam tool of ExPASy 14 23 Structural analyses To probe the molecular architecture of SARSCoV2 3 C Lpro comparative homology modelling was performed using Modeller v 911 17 To select closelyrelated templates for modelling 4 PSIBLAST was performed against all known structures in the protein databank PDB 18 Chimera v 181 19 and PyMOL educational version 20 were used for initial quality estimation energy minimisation mutation analyses and image processing 24 Ligand database preparation and molecular docking A comprehensive medicinal plant library containing 32297 potential antiviral phytochemicals and traditional Chinese medicinal compounds was generated from our previously collected data and studies 13 2123 and screened against the predicted SARSCoV2 3 CLpro structure Molecular operating environment MOE 24 was used for molecular docking ligandprotein interaction and drug likeness analyses All analyses were performed using same protocols that are already described in our previous studies 13 25 26 The qualitative assessment of absorption deposition metabolism excretion and toxicity ADMET profile of selected hits were predicted computationally by using ADMETsar server 27 25 Molecular dynamics simulations Explicit solvent molecular dynamics MD simulations were performed to verify docking results and to analyse the binding behaviour and stability of potential compounds using the predicted 101 SARSCoV2 3C Lpro homology model GROMOS96 and the PRODRG server were employed to run 50 ns MD simulations 28 29 following same protocol as described in our previous studies 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 102 103 104 105 13 30 5 106 107 3 Results and Discussion 108 31 Sequence and structural analyses 111 113 114 115 116 117 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 109 Multiple sequence alignment results revealed that 3 C Lpro was conserved with 100 identity 110 among all SARSCoV2 genomes Next the SARSCoV2 3CLpro protein sequence was compared with it s closest homologs BatCoV SARSCoV MERSCoV HumanCoV and 112 BovineCoV The results revealed that SARSCoV2 3CLpro clustered with bat SARSlike coronaviruses and sharing 9902 sequence identity Fig 1 A Furthermore it shares 9608 8700 9000 and 9000 sequence identity with SARSCoV MERSCoV HumanCoV and BovineCoV homologs respectively Fig 1 B These finding were consistent with an initial study reporting that SARSCoV2 is more similar to SARSCoV than MERSCoV and shares a common ancestor with bat coronaviruses 1 3 31 Analysis of physicochemical parameters 118 revealed that the SARSCoV2 3 CLpro polypeptide is 306 amino acids long with a molecular weight of 3379664 Da and a GRAVY score of 0019 categorising the protein as a stable hydrophilic molecule capable of establishing hydrogen bonds Table 1 Next for comparative modelling BLAST 32 search identified SARSCoV 3C Lpro PDB ID 3M3V as the best possible match in the PDB with 100 query coverage an Evalue of 000 and 9608 sequence identity There were 12point mutations Val35 Thr Ser 46 Ala Asn65 Ser Val 86 Leu Lys88 Arg Ala94 Ser Phe134 His Asn180Lys Val202 Leu Ser267 Ala Ser284 Ala and Leu 286 Ala between SARSCoV and SARSCoV2 3 CLpro enzymes Fig S1 Except for replacement of Leu with Ala at position 286 all other replacements conserve polarity and 127 hydrophobicity However these mutations may affect 3 C Lpro structure and function Therefore 6 128 the 3D structure of SARSCoV2 3 C Lpro was predicted Firstly a single chain monomeric model 129 comprising all domains Domain I residues 8 100 Domain II residues 101 183 Domain III 130 residues 200 303 was built Fig S2 Nterminal amino acids 1 to 7 form the Nfinger that plays a significant role in dimerization and formation of the active site of 3 CLpro Domains I and II collectively referred to as the Nterminal domain includes an antiparallel sheet structure with 13 strands The binding site for the substrate is situated in a cleft between domains I and II A loop from residues 184 to 199 joins the Nterminal domain and Domain III which is also called the Cterminal domain and comprises an antiparallel cluster of five helices The overall 136 molecular architecture of SARSCoV2 3 CLpro was in consistent with the crystal structure of SARSCoV PDB ID 3M3V the root mean square deviation RMSD between the homology model and the template was 0629 Structural and Ramachandran plot analyses revealed that 99 of residues are in favourable regions After quality assessment individual chains were combined to form a homodimeric 3D structure as shown in Fig 1 C To facilitate other researchers the predicted 3 D model has been submitted to the Protein Model Database PMDB 33 and anyone can downloaduse the 143 SARSCoV2 3 CLpro final structure using PMDB ID PM0082635 Further mutational analyses depicted none of the mutations affected the overall structure of SARSCoV2 which fully 145 superimposed on the SARSCoV 3 CLpro structure Fig 1 D The results also revealed that 146 SARSCoV2 has a CysHis catalytic dyad Cys145 and His41 consistent with SARS 3 C Lpro 147 Cys145 and His41 TGEV 3CLpro Cys144 and His41 and HCoV 3CLpro Cys144 and His 41 34 These results revealed that the SARSCoV2 3 CLpro receptorbinding pocket conformation resembles that of the SARSCoV 3 C Lpro binding pocket and raises the possibility 131 132 133 134 135 137 138 139 140 141 142 144 148 149 7 150 that inhibitors intended for SARSCoV 3 CLpro may also inhibit the activity of SARSCoV2 151 3 CLpro 32 Molecular docking 152 153 154 156 157 158 159 160 161 162 163 164 165 166 167 169 170 171 To test this hypothesis we docked RN4tertbutylphenylN2tertbutylamino2oxo1 pyridin3ylethylfuran2carboxamide a potential noncovalent inhibitor of SARSCoV 155 3 CLpro named ML188 35 with the SARSCoV2 3CLpro homology model We also docked ML188 with the SARSCoV 3 CLpro structure PDB ID 3M3V as a reference and ML188 bound strongly to the receptor binding site of SARS CoV 3CLpro The inhibitor targets the Cys His catalytic dyad Cys145 and His41 along with the other residues and the docking score S 1227 was relatively high However surprisingly ML188 did not show significant binding to the catalytic dyad Cys145 and His41 of SARSCoV2 and the docking score S 831 was considerably lower Fig S3 These results indicated that the 12 point mutations identified at previous step may disrupt important hydrogen bonds and alter the receptor binding site thereby affecting it s ability to bind with the SARSCoV inhibitor Therefore it was essential to discover novel compounds that may inhibit SARSCoV2 3CLpro and serve as potential antiCOVID19 drug compounds We developed a library from our previously published studies that contains numerous natural compounds possessing potential antiviral activities and screened it against the SARSCoV2 3 CLpro homology model Recent 168 drug repurposing studies proposed few drugs that target SARSC o V2 3 CLpro and suggested that they could be used to treat COVID19 Herein we selected the best of these Nelfinavir Prulifloxacin and Colistin from three different drug repurposing studies 36 37 and docked them as controls in the present study Fig S4 Our analyses identified nine novel nontoxic 8 172 173 174 175 176 177 178 179 180 181 182 183 184 185 186 188 189 190 191 192 193 194 druggable natural compounds that are predicted to bind with the receptor binding site and catalytic dyad Cys 145 and His41 of SARSCoV2 3CLpro Table 2 Fig S5 ADMET profiling of the selected hits is given in Table S2 Among these screened phytochemicals 5734tetrahydroxy233dimethylallyl isoflavone is an isoflavone extracted from Psorothamnus arborescens 38 that exhibited the highest binding affinity 2957 kcalmol and docking score S 1635 and formed strong hydrogen bonds with the catalytic dyad residues Cys145 and His41 as well as significant interactions with the receptorbinding residues Thr24 Thr25 Thr26 Cys 44 Thr45 Ser46 Met49 As n 142 Gly 143 His 164 Glu 166 and Gln 189 Fig 1E A literature review revealed that 5734 tetrahy droxy 233 d ime th ylallyl isoflavone has been successfully used as an antileishmanial agent 38 and it is also found in traditional Chinese medicine records 39 Our screened phytochemicals displayed higher docking scores stronger binding energies and more closer interactions with the conserved catalytic dyad residues Cys145 and His41 than Nelfinavir Prulifloxacin and Colistin These results suggested that natural products identified in our study may prove more useful candidates for COVID19 drug therapy 187 33 MD simulations To further investigate the molecular docking results the top three phytochemical complexes namely 5734tetrahydroxy233dimethylallyl isoflavone myricitrin and methyl rosmarinate were subjected to 50 ns MD simulation The root mean square deviation RMSD root mean square fluctuation RMSF radius of gyration RoG and hydrogen bond parameters were calculated RMSD is an indicator of the stability of ligandprotein complexes None of the complex showed any obvious fluctuations and all three were stable with average RMSD values of 16 002 15 002 and 17 002 for 5734tetrahydroxy233dimethylallyl 9 195 196 197 198 200 201 202 204 205 206 209 210 211 213 214 215 216 isoflavone myricitrin and methyl rosmarinate respectively Fig 2A RMSF is an indicator of residual flexibility Minimal fluctuations were observed for myricitrin and methyl rosmarinate and the overall complexes remained stable throughout the simulations The functionally important catalytic dyad residues Cys145 and His41 displayed stable behaviour and 199 fluctuations were observed toward the Cterminal end of the SARSCo V2 3 C Lpro molecule Fig 2B RoG is an indicator of protein compactness stability and folding and the results suggested normal behaviour for all three complexes all remained compact and stable throughout the 50 ns simulations Fig 2C In addition hydrogen bonds which are the main stabilising interactions 203 factors in proteins suggested that the SARSCoV2 3 CLpro internal hydrogen bonds remain stable throughout the simulation with no obvious fluctuations Fig 2D These results confirmed our findings and further indicated that these compounds may serve as potential antiCOVID19 drug sources 207 4 Conclusion 208 In conclusion our study revealed that 3 C Lpro is conserved in SARSCoV2 It is highly similar to bat SARSlike coronavirus 3 CLpro with some differences from other betacoronaviruses We predicted the 3 D structure of the SARSCoV2 3 CLpro enzyme and the findings may help researchers working on COVID19 drug discovery Despite significant overall similarity with the 212 SARSCoV 3 CLpro structure the SARSCoV2 3 CLpro substrate binding site had some key differences which highlighted the need for rapid drug discovery to address the alarming COVID19 pandemic Medicinal plant compounds are already used to successfully treat numerous viral diseases Herein we screened a medicinal plant database containing 32297 potential antiviral phytochemicals and selected the top nine hits that may inhibit SARSCoV2 10 218 219 220 221 225 226 227 228 229 230 232 233 234 235 236 237 217 3 CLpro activity and hence virus replication Further invitro and invivo analyses are required to transform these potential inhibitors into clinical drugs We anticipate that the insights obtained in the present study may prove valuable for exploring and developing novel natural antiCOVID19 therapeutic agents in the future 223 The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest 222 Conflict of interests 224 Acknowledgements This work was supported by the Hubei Provincial Natural Science Foundation of
