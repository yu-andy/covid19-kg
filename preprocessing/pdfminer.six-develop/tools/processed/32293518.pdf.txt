mortality of wwwwhoint While COVID19 is 363 COVID19 has resulted in more death cases than SARS and MERS combined 1 Within China a total of 80955 cases are confirmed with 4257 severe cases in mainland China wwwnhc govcn In severe cases of COVID19 patients ex perience rapid disease progression and can quickly progress syndrome ARDS 2 respiratory distress to acute Based on this when COVD19 patients develop ARDS and mechanical ventilation can not be improved extra corporeal membrane oxygenation ECMO can be used 3 As mortality rates among critically ill COVID19 pa tients can be as high as 615 4 ECMO may play a role in reducing mortality rates 5 The indications of using ECMO are For patients with severe ARDS it is recommended to perform lung expansion In the case of adequate human resources prone positioning should be least 12 hours per day for recommended for at Correspondence yangbingxiang163com songting163com yanqiaoyuan163com Yingchun Zeng Zhongxiang Cai and Yunyan Xianyu contributed

Medical College Huazhong University of Science and Technology Wuhan Hubei Province China Full list of author information is available at the end of the article ventilation protective failure persisted then ECMO should be started as soon as possible 6 respiratory severe If Worldwide data on prognosis when using ECMO to treat critically ill patients with COVID19 infection are not available and whether ECMO plays a role in reducing patient mortality rates is currently unknown This research letter provides the first evidence of prognosis in treating critically ill COVID19 patients with ECMO in China These preliminary data were collected from two medical centers of Wuhan China Table 1 These data could be of considerable value in judging whether ECMO should be recommended as a salvage therapy for critically ill COVID19 patients To date the role of ECMO in the management of COVID19 is unpromising Nearly half of the patients treated with ECMO died from septic shock and multiple organ failure The observed late complications included bleeding and infection While the World Health Organization WHO interim guidelines and Chinas na tional interim guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID19 infection sixth version have made gen eral recommendations for the use of ECMO for ARDS and critical COVID19 infection 3 5 the preliminary evidence available in mainland China does not support this general recommendation Certainly understanding the risktobenefit ratio of performing ECMO on critically ill COVID19 patients is dynamic as the course of this novel disease unfolds The Chinese government covers all costs to treat patients with the COVID19 infection so the cost analysis of to date unavailable in mainland China ECMO is The Authors 2020 Open Access This

care unit However an average ECMO procedure in the USA costs 73122 USD indicating that ECMO is a highly resourcedemanding procedure 7 Therefore a further larger sample size study and a comprehensive analysis of the medical value of using ECMO on COVID19 pa tients are urgently required Based on the two cohort case series in this study nearly half of the critically ill COVID19 patients with ECMO were dying from septic shock and multiple organ failure As anticipated by MacLaren et al 3 COVID19 is a pandemic all health care resources are stretched so that ECMO is not a ther apy to be rushed to
