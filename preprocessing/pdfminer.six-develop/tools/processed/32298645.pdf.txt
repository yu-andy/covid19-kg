affected by COVID19 than adult s 13 However the lack of highquality evidence for this situation and the steadfast pace of new and conicting information has been an over all challenge to all medical specialties including neonatal intensive care In reality the current knowledge on neonatal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV 2 infection is limited Therefore several questions remain unanswered while at the same time the neonatal commu nity needs to take action Not surprisingly this has caused signicant stress amongst neonatal health care providers All over the world a number of important groups have been diligently working on the development of protocols cid2 Please cite this article as Procianoy RS Silveira RC Manzoni P SantAnna G Neonatal COVID19 little evidence

In Brazil a signicant number of documents on this subject have been rapidly produced by national entities such as the Brazilian Society of Pediatrics the Ministry of Health and the Neonatal Resuscitation Program811 Undoubtedly these are critical and paramount steps in the ght against the out break but given the constant updating and some conicting information health care providers are facing difculties in determining best local guidelines To make things even more challenging daily and often nonscientic news is released by the press IgG and IgM antibodies What s known about neonatal COVID19 infection It is not yet established whether COVID19 has transpla cental or vertical transmission Recently a report from China described three infants with elevated serum lev els of for SARSCoV2 after birth 1213 The postnatal courses were benign and quan titative reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction RTPCR from nasopharyngeal swabs serum vaginal secre tions and maternal breast milk were negative Thus in the light of negative RTPCR results and given that IgM false pos itives results are not uncommon and that the decline of IGM levels were very unusual in comparison

more on the severity of the maternal infection andor concomitant obstetric diseases rather than on a putative transmission of the COVID19 from the pregnant mother to the fetus 15 At this point very few positive conrmed neonatal COVID19 cases have been reported in scientic journals and all of them had no symptoms or very mild to moderate symptoms with no fatal cases reported in infants 28 days131619 Acquisition of COVID19 has been so far attributed to hori zontal transmission from an infected mother or health care provider rather than vertical Based on this limited evi dence no specic clinical picture for neonatal COVID19 infection has consistently emerged Indeed a few positive cases of neonatal COVID19 in Brazil have been very recently reported by the news or personal communications and clin ical presentations and neonatal courses were reassuringly similar to the reported cases Nevertheless as the disease continues to spread throughout the world we must remain vigilant What should neonatal health care providers do about COVID19 First all aspects involved in neonatal care inten sive or not must be reevaluated in the context of the pandemic Normal newborn nurseries neonatal units of intermediatelevel care and neonatal intensive care units NICUs must be prepared and adopt practices that follow the best available evidence for the outbreak This effort involves guidelines for the following organization of unit space andor isolation rooms or special areas for suspected or conrmed cases policies for visitation by parents and family and adoption of personal protective equipment PPE during delivery of a suspected or positive COVID19 mother or during neonatal care Moreover clear guidelines are needed for all types of procedures in the delivery room or during the hospital stay such as cord clamping cleaning of secretions suction of airways and stomach use of all the different types of respiratory support breastfeeding oper ational protocols for inhospital transport to radiology or operating rooms transport of outborn neonates and selec tionscheduling of cases that should be tested What should be done for the overall care after birth Clinical conditions of mother and newborn will determine the care after birth If the mother has suspected or con rmed COVID19 both are stable and the infant is not preterm neonatal health care providers must offer orien tations regarding precautions to avoid spreading the virus including washing of the mothers hands before touching the infant using a face mask while breastfeeding and staying in isolated roomingin However if the mother or the newborn are sick they should stay separated while considering the mothers intention to breastfeed by expressing breast milk limiting visits and maintaining adequate isolation measures during the hospital stay20 Neonates positive for COVID 19 must be isolated and clinically monitored in order to prevent outbreaks in the NICU Owing to the absence of evi dence for vertical transmission as well as for transmission through breast milk most scientic organizations are rec ommending not to separate mothers and neonates with the aim of promoting breastfeeding and neonatal bonding with the exception of cases with severely symptomatic mothers in such cases barrier measures are suggested as well as administration of expressed maternal milk 21 Procianoy RS et al What to do when neonatal respiratory care is needed Important questions related to respiratory management dur ing the immediate postpartum period of infants born from suspected or positive COVID19 mothers and the necessary protection that health care providers should use have been addressed 22 Also questions have been raised about what forms of respiratory support can be safely used in the NICU in infants admitted with suspected or conrmed COVID19 or who became positive during hospitalization very Can we continue to use current respiratory strategies Yes with a few suggested modications to address the pos sibility of aerosol generation and exhaled air dispersion during oxygen administration and ventilatory support2324 Of note a systematic review published in 2014 by the World Health Organization WHO graded the evidence for using precautions against aerosol generation and exhaled air dis low with no studies evaluating neonate s 25 persion as Based on engineering data using adult models the like lihood of signicant aerosol generation and air dispersion during bag and mask ventilation continuous positive airway pressure nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation high ow nasal cannula therapy endotracheal intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation is quite low but not negligible 2628 Given the lack of strong and clear scientic evidence during this pandemic and until more information becomes available health care providers should use full PPE during respiratory care of infants with suspected or conrmed cases This should include gloves a longsleeved gown eye protection and a N95 mask or the equivalent Also it is recommended that infants with suspected or positive COVID19 infection should be treated in negative pressure rooms or isolated using a 2 m distance between incubators in open plan NICUs Two nal points deserve special attention immedi ate endotracheal intubation and use of bacterialviral lters There is no evidence that neonates need to be immediately intubated in case of respiratory deterioration solely because of COVID19 infection First because the pathophysiology of the disease is different no cases of neonatal SARSCoV2 infection have been documented Sec ond mechanical ventilationassociated lung injury is clearly an issue when dealing with neonatal lungs 29 Third data coming from adults suggests that endotracheal intubation is the major aerosol generating procedure and should not be performed prophylactically 2324 Fourth during previous viral epidemics a number of adults were successfully treated with noninvasive respiratory support without any evidence of increased contamination or aerosol dispersion 23 Thus the only recommended modication for contemporary respi ratory care is the use of bacterialviral hydrophobic lters located at the expiratory part of the systems Any strat egy in such neonates should be tailored to the individual patient rather than to the disease This has already been clearly outlined by the Brazilian Pediatric Society and the national Neonatal Resuscitation Program89 It is important to highlight that the addition of a lter although effec tive in decreasing viral dispersion adds dead space and increases system resistance which could be harmful to preterm infants if left in place for long periods There fore when using these lters health care providers should be mindful of the potential complications and monitor the infants closely Also in infants receiving bubble continuous Model ARTICLE IN PRESS Neonatal COVID19 little evidence and the
