guideline for local authorities to promote psychological crisis intervention for patients medical personnel people under medical observation and civilians during the COVID19 outbreak6 However what type of mental disorders are prevalent and how they distribute among population are not know So a rapid assessment of outbreakassociated men tal disorders for both civilians and health care workers is needed 7 The official departments strive to improve the publics awareness of prevention and interven tion strategies by providing daily updates about surveillance and active cases on websites and social media3 Besides many selfmedia and netizens also release and transfer related infor mation on social media such as WeChat and Weibo Social media may lead to misinforma tion overload89 which in turn may cause mental health problems WHO pointed out that identifying the underlying drivers of fear anxiety and stigma that fuel misinformation and rumour particularly through social media10 Previous studies indicated that indirect exposure to mass trauma through the media can increase the initial rates of posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD symptoms11 A previous study also shown social media exposure may positively related to forming risk perceptions during the MERS outbreak in South Korea12 But there was no study to examine the association between social media exposure and mental health problems So the current study aims to describes the prevalence and distribution of two major mental disordersanxiety and depression among Chinese population 13 and examine their associations with social media exposure by rapid assessment during COVID19 outbreak Materials and methods Design and participants This crosssectional study was online conducted during Jan 31 to Feb 2 2020 Chinese citizens age d 18 years old were invited to participate online survey though Wenjuanxing platform httpswwwwjxcnappsurveyaspx In total 5851 participants took part in the survey After removing the participants without completed questionnaires 4872 participants from 31 provinces and autonomous regions were involved in the current study A written consent in the first section of online survey was given to all participants before filling the questionnaire This study has been approved by the Institutional Review Board of Fudan University School of Public HealthIRB 2020010800 Measurements Mental health problems According to a previous study two major mental disorders depression and anxiety 13 were assessed in the current study Depression was assessed by The Chinese version of WHOFive WellBeing Index WHO514 which consists of five positively worded items that reflect the presence or absence of wellbeing rather than depres sive symptomatology Participants are asked to report the presence of these positive feelings in the last 2 weeks on a 6 point scale ranging from all of the time 5 points to at no time 0 points A summed score below 13 indicates depression 14 Anxiety was assessed by Chinese version of generalized anxiety disorder scale GAD71516 which consists 7 symptoms Par ticipants were asked how often they were bothered by each symptom during the last 2 weeks Response options were not at all several days more than half the days and nearly every day scored as 0 1 2 and 3 respectively A score of 10 or greater represents a reasonable cut point for identifying cases of anxiety1516S1 Table Social media exposure SME Social media exposure was measured by asking how often respondents during the past week were exposed to news and information about COVID19 on social media such as Sina weibo Zhihu Douban WeChat and etc S1 Table Response options were never once in a while sometimes often and very often Because of less PLOS ONE

httpsdoiorg101371journalpone0231924g003 COVID19 outbroke in Wuhan China These findings are consistent with the previous stud ies that exposing public health emergency can cause public mental health problems such as Wenchuan and Lushan earthquakes17 2014 Ebola Outbreak718 and SARS19 Social media is one of main channels updating the COVID19 information 3 This study also found that 820 of participants frequently expose them to social media and frequently SME associated high odds of anxiety and CDA which is consistent with previous studies 11 there may be two reasons explaining the association between frequently SME and mental health During COVID19 outbreak disinformation and false reports about the COVID19 have bom barded social media and stoked unfounded fears among many netizen s 20 which may confuse people and harm peoples mental health9 Besides many citizens expressed their negative feel ings such as fear worry nervous anxiety et al on social media which are contagious social net work 2122 So WHOs infodemics team is working hand in glove with countries PLOS ONE httpsdoiorg101371journalpone0231924 April 16 2020 7 10 PLOS ONE Mental health problems during

but the formers faced higher odds of anxiety It indicated that participants from Hubei prov ince the infectious focus directly expose to public health emergency and may suffer more men tal health problemes 1719 Compared with the control measures taken by other cities Wuhan have sealed off the city from all outside contact to stop the spread of the COVID19 As the pre vention and control measures called new standard by WHO24 the lockdown of Wuhan is a very effective way to interrupt the transmission of the virus however the strictest measures in Wuhan might lead to more serious mental health problems of local people Some potential limitations should be noted in this study First this is a crosssectional study so it is difficult to accurately elucidate causal relationships between SME and mental health Additional longitudinal studies such as cohort studies or nested casecontrol studies are essential in the future Although large sample the survey was conducted online which is suitable for rapid assessment so some respondent bias such as few elder citizens participa tion may have affected the results Finally although we did control for many covariates we can not exclude the possibility of some residual confounding caused by unmeasured factors Conclusions In conclusion our findings show there are high prevalence of mental health problems which positively associated with frequently SME during the COVID19 outbreak These findings implicated the government need pay more attention to mental health among general popula tion while combating with COVID19 Fortunately The China government have provided mental health services by varied channel including hotline online consultation online course and outpatient consultation 6 but more attention should be paid to depression and anxiety The next implication is to combat with infodemic by monitoring and filtering out false infor mation and promoting accurate information though crosssection collaborations
