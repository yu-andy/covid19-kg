ABSTRACT

The  disease  caused  by  the  new  coronavirus  (SARS-CoV-2),  designated  COVID-19, 
emerged  in  late  2019  in  China,  in  the  city  of  Wuhan  (Hubei  province),  and  showed 
exponential growth in that country. It subsequently spread to all continents, and infection 
with  SARS-CoV-2  is  now  classified  as  a  pandemic.  Given  the  magnitude  achieved, 
scientific interest in COVID-19 has also grown in the international literature, including its 
manifestations on imaging studies, particularly on CT. To date, no case series have been 
published in Brazil. Therefore, our objective was to describe the CT findings in an initial 
series of 12 patients.

Keywords: Coronavirus infections; Coronavirus; Multidetector computed tomography.

In late 2019, a new coronavirus—severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)—was identified as 
the causative agent of an outbreak of pneumonia in China, 
in the city of Wuhan (Hubei province). An association was 
found between the first cases and a local food market 
that sold live animals, where most of such patients had 
been on business or visiting.

of  COVID-19,  have  been  in  areas  where  widespread 
transmission has been documented, or have had potential 
exposure due to participation in events or have been in 
places where cases of COVID-19 have been reported. 
Among the most commonly reported clinical manifestations 
of  COVID-19  are  fever,  fatigue,  dry  cough,  anorexia, 
myalgia, dyspnea, and sputum production.(7)

The spread of the new coronavirus was rapid, resulting 
in an epidemic, with the main form of transmission being 
person-to-person, either via the airways or by touching 
contaminated  surfaces  and  then  the  eyes,  nose,  or 
mouth. The epidemic hit other continents, and the disease 
was called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). New 
cases started being reported in other countries, initially 
in individuals who had travelled to China and in people 
who had had contact with them, and outbreaks related 
to local transmission were subsequently documented.(1-4) 
COVID-19 is currently considered a pandemic.

The spectrum of clinical presentation of COVID-19 is 
wide, ranging from absence of symptoms to critical disease. 
Most respiratory infections are mild, but severe or critical 
forms have been also described, especially in the elderly 
and individuals with comorbidities, who can present with 
dyspnea, hypoxemia, extensive pulmonary involvement on 
imaging studies, respiratory failure, shock, and multiple 
organ failure. The estimated COVID-19 mortality in China 
was 2.3%, most cases having occurred in elderly patients 
or patients with comorbidities (cardiovascular disease, 
diabetes  mellitus,  chronic  lung  disease,  hypertension, 
and  cancer).(5)  However,  the  reported  mortality  rates 
vary in different populations; in Italy, for example, where 
the mean age of the affected population is higher, the 
currently reported mortality rate is approximately 5.8%.(6)

The possibility of COVID-19 should be considered in 
symptomatic patients who, in the past 14 days, have 
had close contact with a suspected or confirmed case 

The  diagnosis  of  COVID-19  is  confirmed  through 
detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse-transcriptase 
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from nasopharyngeal 
or oropharyngeal swab samples. However, if RT-PCR is 
negative and clinical suspicion is high, the recommendation 
is  that  RT-PCR  testing  be  performed  again,  including 
on swabs from other respiratory sites. It is also worth 
highlighting the value of testing for other viruses that 
can clinically present in a similar way.

Multiple  articles  have  been  published  reporting  CT 
findings  in  COVID-19,  even  in  patients  with  negative 
RT-PCR results, arousing interest in the role of CT in the 
current clinical scenario. The American College of Radiology 
and the Brazilian College of Radiology recommend that 
chest CT be used in hospitalized patients with pneumonia 
symptoms and with specific clinical indications for CT; it 
is important to point out that neither of them recommend 
using  CT  for  screening  of  COVID-19  or  as  the  test  of 
choice for diagnosing COVID-19.(8,9)

Chest CT can help in the diagnosis of COVID-19, but it 
cannot confirm or exclude it alone. When RT-PCR is used 
as a reference, chest CT has high sensitivity (97%) but 
low specificity (25%), given the overlap of findings with 
those of respiratory infections of different etiologies.(10)

The  most  commonly  observed  CT  findings  in  cases 
of  COVID-19  are  pulmonary  ground-glass  opacities 
and, occasionally, consolidations, with a predominantly 
peripheral distribution, sometimes associated with fine 
reticulation (forming the crazy-paving pattern), vascular

thickening,  and  the  reversed  halo  sign.  Central 
parenchymal involvement or the presence of nodules, 
cavitation, lymph node enlargement, or pleural effusion 
are  less  common.(11-13)  It  has  been  suggested  that 
the reversed halo sign, described by some authors, 
indicates that organizing pneumonia might be one of 
the mechanisms of lung injury.(14,15)

The objective of the present study was to describe the 
major CT findings in the first case series of COVID-19 in 
Brazil. In this initial experience in Brazil, involving the 
first 12 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 
(based on RT-PCR results) who underwent chest CT at 
our facility, the following CT features were observed: 
ground-glass opacities, in 12 patients (100%); crazy-
paving pattern, in 7 (58%); alveolar consolidation, in 
4 (33%); reversed halo sign, in 1 (8%); and pleural 
effusion, in 1 (8%). Nodules, cavitation, and lymph 
node enlargement were not identified in our sample.

We observed involvement of both lungs in 11 patients 
(92%) and a peripheral predominance in 9 patients 
(75%); the changes affected mainly the lower lobes 
in  8  patients  (67%),  were  multilobar  and  relatively 
diffuse in 3 patients (25%), and predominated in the 
left lower lobe in 1 patient (8%).

Figure 1 illustrates a typical case and demonstrates 
the  evolution  of  the  findings,  whereas  Figure  2 
demonstrates not only the major changes caused by 
the  disease  but  also  another  possible  but  relatively 
uncommon finding (small pleural effusion).

this type of opacity is low. However, of course, chest 
X-rays can be useful in monitoring inpatients, including 
those  who  are  in  the  ICU,  because  it  is  a  widely 
available,  rapid,  and  inexpensive  test  that  enables 
more frequent (often daily) monitoring of the extent 
of the pulmonary involvement in the disease.

It  has  been  demonstrated  that  asymptomatic 
individuals  can  present  with  pulmonary  findings 
(clinical-radiological dissociation), but less frequently 
than do symptomatic patients and, in general, with 
less extensive involvement and predominant ground-
glass  opacities.  In  contrast,  symptomatic  patients 
more  commonly  present  with  pulmonary  findings, 
with predominant consolidations and more extensive 
parenchymal involvement.(16)

Despite the variety of presentations, it has generally 
been reported that, in the first 4 days after symptom 
onset, the ground-glass opacity pattern predominates. 
Between  days  5  and  8  after  symptom  onset,  there 
is  an  increase  in  the  extent  of  the  pulmonary 
involvement,  with  the  presence  of  crazy-paving 
pattern and consolidations. Between days 9 and 13 
after symptom onset, when CT findings are usually at 
their peak, consolidations are noted to predominate; 
after day 14, the process of consolidation resorption 
begins and the crazy-paving pattern tends to resolve, 
although ground-glass opacities may persist.(17) The 
resolution  of  the  findings  is  usually  relatively  slow, 
taking approximately 30 days, and scarring changes 
in the lung parenchyma have been described.

Because  the  major  imaging  finding  in  COVID-19 
is  ground-glass  opacities,  chest  X-ray  plays  a  less 
important role in the imaging evaluation of patients, 
given that the sensitivity of chest X-rays for detecting 

The  major  CT  features  identified  in  the  first  12 
Brazilian  patients  evaluated  at  our  facility  are  very 
similar to those being described in the literature and 
fundamentally include bilateral multifocal ground-glass

findings suggestive of COVID-19 (fever, sore throat, and frequent dry cough), demonstrating the most commonly described 
pattern: numerous bilateral multifocal ground-glass opacities, associated with fine reticulation and interlobular septal 
thickening (crazy-paving pattern), involving various lung lobes and being predominantly peripheral in distribution in the 
parenchyma and a little more extensive in the posterior regions of the lower lobes. The patient had a positive RT-PCR 
result for COVID-19 on the day he underwent the first CT scan (images on the left in each pair) and was hospitalized. A 
second CT scan, which was performed three days later (images on the right in each pair) because he continued to have 
fever spikes and dry cough, demonstrated an increase in the number and extent of pulmonary opacities.

61-year-old male patient with peripheral and posterior ground-glass opacities in the lower lobes (blue arrows in the right 
lower lobe), as well as a focus of parenchymal opacification in the lingula. In B and C, a 41-year-old male patient with 
extensive ground-glass opacities associated with septal thickening and fine reticulation (crazy-paving) in the right upper 
lobe, in addition to other small scattered foci in the upper and lower left lobes. In D, an 85-year-old male patient with 
ground-glass opacities, associated with fine reticulation and thickening of some interlobular septa, extending mostly into 
the periphery of the left lower lobe, but also present in the lingula and in the right lower lobe. In E and F, a 42-year-old 
male patient with ground-glass opacities and bilateral foci of consolidation, predominantly in the most posterior regions 
of the lower lobes. The patient also had bilateral minimal pleural effusion (arrows), a relatively uncommon finding in 
patients with COVID-19. In addition, signs suggestive of hepatic steatosis were identified.

opacities, sometimes associated with fine reticulation 
and septal thickening (crazy-paving pattern), in general 
involving several lung lobes and being predominantly 
peripheral in distribution in the parenchyma. The low 
incidence of pleural effusion and the absence of other 
findings, such as lymph node enlargement, nodules, 
and cavitary lesions, are in line with recent international 
experiences.(10-17)

The most common CT findings in COVID-19 overlap 
with those observed in pulmonary infections caused by 

other agents (particularly other viruses), and, ideally, 
the definitive diagnosis of COVID-19 should be based 
on RT-PCR results. Nevertheless, given the magnitude 
achieved  by  COVID-19  in  recent  months,  with  the 
disease being classified as a pandemic by the World 
Health Organization, it is essential that clinicians and 
radiologists be familiar with the most common imaging 
presentations of COVID-19, as well as with the expected 
evolution of the findings, so that they can contribute 
to earlier identification of cases and thus to reducing 
the consequences and mortality of the disease.
