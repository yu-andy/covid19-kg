Learnings for Health Economics from the Early Stages of the COVID‑19 
Pandemic

As I write, in March 2020, the world is in the early stages 
of dealing with a novel strain of coronavirus that emerged 
in China and spread worldwide. Whilst research is being 
conducted on and about the virus, the topic of this editorial 
is not the virus per se, rather a reflection of the implications 
for our field. I look at how we stand compared with adjacent 
fields and the implications for health economics (HE).

1   Where Health Economics Compares Well

Over  the  past  few  weeks,  models  of  the  pandemic  have 
started to emerge. Like many economists, I have read these 
with interest. The focus of models available to date differs 
from those we typically see (in focussing on the spread 
over time rather than the total impact), but they are not far 
removed from the models regularly published in HE, espe-
cially where infectious diseases are involved [1]. However, 
as a whole, we do seem to compare favourably as a disci-
pline in two areas: transparency and sensitivity analysis.

On the transparency front, seldom will you find an HE 
presentation, paper, or material that does not include a model 
diagram and a table of inputs. Although it may not always be 
possible to perfectly recreate models from reported data, we 
can get fairly close [2]. This has not been the case for many 
of the COVID-19 models released to date. They may have 
been written up under time pressure (and thus are not nec-
essarily generalisable to the models built by entire fields), 
but it is hard to critique a model properly without seeing the 
inputs used. Similarly, model and data structures are vitally 
important and can determine much of the shape of the final 
results.

More reassuring is the approach we take as a discipline 
to sensitivity and scenario analysis. As modellers, we know 
that some inputs are massively influential on results, and 
rarely are we certain of their true values. Given this uncer-
tainty, it is rare to find HE work without extensive sensitiv-
ity analysis to consider both the parameter and the struc-
tural uncertainties—more often than not accounting for the 
correlation between parameters. Of the epidemiological 
models reported to date, too few have taken such a rigorous 
approach—in many cases relying on point estimates with 
little consideration of ‘other states of the world’. Where 
outputs are similar, probabilistic estimates may be approxi-
mated by deterministic runs for expediency (for example, 
in sensitivity analysis). However, even then, for the main 
results the underlying uncertainty should be propagated 
through models, especially where so many unknowns exist 
[3].

2   What Health Economics Can Learn From 
the COVID‑19 Work Presented to Date

Although HE does appear to perform strongly in presenting 
numerical summaries of model results, research is increas-
ingly showing the importance of how uncertainty is commu-
nicated [4]. Even when we have many facts at our disposal, 
we are considerably more certain of some facts than oth-
ers—for example, in the case of COVID-19, the number of 
deaths, as opposed to the number of cases (which is depend-
ent on how many tests are performed and on whom). To 
reflect uncertainty, the UK government scientific advisors 
have stated not only estimates but also their confidence in 
their estimates of effect sizes [5]. This approach was taken 
from another high-profile modelling effort of even greater 
importance than COVID-19—that of the Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) [6].

Given  the  volume  of  evidence  that  is  surrounded  by 
uncertainty,  the  IPCC  have  sought  to  standardise  the

language  used  to  communicate  uncertainty,  backed  by 
behavioural science research. If the IPCC provides esti-
mates or statements, they use a standardised language: an 
outcome stated to be ‘very likely’ in all cases will mean it 
is predicted to happen with 90–100% probability. The IPCC 
work then goes further by discussing the degree of agree-
ment in the evidence (low, medium or high) and the quality 
of evidence (limited, medium or robust) [7]. Standardisation 
of an approach to describing uncertainty in HE would avoid 
misinterpretation, both within and outside our discipline, 
using a common currency. As a starting point, we could do 
a lot worse than adopting the excellent work of the IPCC – as 
has been done for COVID-19 scientific advice.

The second area where HE could stand to learn is in 
involvement and impact on policy and the media. Over the 
past weeks, terminology from other areas such as  R0 (the 
basic reproduction number of a disease) and ‘exponential 
growth’ have made their way into common parlance. How-
ever, HE has not (for whatever reason) managed to convey 
the concept of opportunity cost. Sadly, media discussions on 
the level of ‘lockdown’ required around the world present a 
false dichotomy between lives and ‘the economy’, generally 
defined as gross domestic product. As a field, we know that 
trade-offs are regularly made between health and wealth—
ultimately because of the problem of scarce resources. More 
concerning is the (near absent) discussion around the oppor-
tunity cost of the policies pursued in terms of health impact. 
This applies to the direct effects of postponing usual care 
and enforcing isolation on households (with health impacts) 
but also indirectly the health gains that could be achieved 
with more funding in less exceptional times. Some notable 
examples of prioritisation are coming to light [8], but once 
HE models have been produced we will see estimates of 
cost per life-year (potentially quality adjusted), which will 
lay bare the choices that have been made. If decisions are 
shown to be cost effective, this will seemingly be by accident 
as opposed to by design.

3   Implications for Health Economics

However, the crisis that has emerged has shone a light on 
other areas that HE is not alone in facing. The first of these 
is the speed of science and peer review. Given the rapidly 
evolving nature of the situation, pre-prints have played a 
large role in the scientific discussion. Some of these are 
excellent [9], but many contain notable flaws and/or unstated 
limitations and would be unlikely to be accepted for publica-
tion in their existing format—underlining the importance of 
peer review as quality control. There have been examples of 
good science done quickly [10], but—for the most part (as 
would be expected)—publication incorporating peer review 
cannot keep up. In COVID-19, this can be explained by how 

quickly the virus and containment measures have emerged, 
but it is not explainable in our field—in what have been less 
urgent times.

HE cannot (and should not try to) speed up the scientific 
process or dictate to other groups—especially on something 
as fast moving as the current crisis. However, we can get 
our own house in order. At present, it is not unusual to wait 
6 months (or more) for peer review comments—leading to 
work appearing in press over a year or more since it was sub-
mitted (indeed, submission and formatting of papers can be 
a painful process in itself). At the same time, as researchers, 
we are inundated with peer review requests in addition to our 
actual jobs—these come with little recognition or apprecia-
tion. A more sustainable solution needs to be found, likely 
involving public recognition and/or some form of (token) 
monetary reward.

At its foundation, the peer-reviewed publication process 
exists to deliver thoroughly reviewed research in a timely 
manner. It is an expensive exercise but is increasingly not 
delivering as the volume of research has increased. Since 
most of us have had to rapidly become accustomed to vide-
oconferencing, perhaps this ‘lockdown’ time could be used 
to gather stakeholders and look for a more expedient and 
fairer way of doing things? Simpler processes for submis-
sion for authors, a charter of minimum standards for journals 
to adhere to (in review time, decision times, and time to 
online publication), and recognition for reviewers (whatever 
appropriate form that may take). For some publications, this 
will only formalise what they are doing already; for others, 
it would give authors reassurance on how their work will 
be handled.

A second reflection is on the ‘rule of rescue’ [11] and 
whether we truly understand public preferences. Interest-
ingly, the UK National Institute for Care and Excellence 
(NICE) Citizen’s Council only suggested an exception of 
exceeding standard thresholds to ‘avert’ an epidemic as 
opposed to dealing with the reality of one [12]. We acknowl-
edge society is prepared to spend more to save identifiable 
individuals (Chilean miners, the Thai cave rescue, and many 
more examples)—this is the rule of rescue. But does this 
also extend to saving unidentifiable individuals from iden-
tifiable diseases, i.e. from COVID-19? If so, this has impli-
cations for health technology assessment—every disease 
assessed becomes ‘special’ by virtue of having a spotlight 
shone on it. Since the original work on this topic was pro-
duced, we have also had the introduction of the 24-h news 
cycle and, especially, social media. McKie and Richardson 
[11] discussed at length the role of media-set priorities, and 
their comments are worth re-reading and perhaps revisiting 
in this new era.

A  more  general  reflection/implication  relates  to  the 
unprecedented (at least during peacetime) changes enforced 
on society and healthcare services as a result of COVID-19. 

These changes show that the existing systems are social 
constructs—things can be done differently if the will exists. 
If systems are now acknowledged as malleable (and this 
is maintained), this gives HE a chance to propose ways to 
improve the efficiency of healthcare systems rather than 
needing to treat them as fixed and work within them. This 
could increase the scope of potential health gains and be a 
small positive we can take from the current situation.
