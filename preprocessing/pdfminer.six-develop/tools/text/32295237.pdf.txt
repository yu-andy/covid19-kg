Abstract:  A  new  Coronavirus  strain,  named  SARS-CoV-2,  suddenly  emerged  in  early  December 
2019. SARS-CoV-2 resulted in being dramatically infectious, with thousands of people infected. In 
this  scenario,  and  without  effective  vaccines  available,  the  importance  of  an  immediate  tool  to 
support patients and against viral diffusion becomes evident. In this study, we exploit the molecular 
docking  approach  to  analyze  the  affinity  between  different  viral  proteins  and  several  inhibitors, 
originally developed for other viral infections. Our data show that, in some cases, a relevant binding 
can  be  detected.  These  findings  support  the  hypothesis  to  develop  new  antiviral  agents  against 
COVID-19, on the basis of already established therapies.

1. Introduction 

In early December 2019, a sudden and dramatic outbreak of a new Coronavirus strain, named 
SARS–CoV-2, emerged in the continental Chinese area of Wuhan and quickly  diffused throughout 
the country. To date, several cases of viruses were reported in Europe and in the US. The SARS–CoV-
2  is  strongly  infectious,  with  more  than  81,000  infected  people  and  around  3000  deaths  reported 
within three  months from  the  virus appearance  (update  on 14th of April:  more  than 1.9 milion of 
confirmed cases and about 120 thousands deaths reported). The rapid spread of the new virus reveals 
that the mechanism of diffusion is somehow different from that of  Filoviridae, (i.e., Ebolavirus) [1]. 
The viral pathogenesis results in symptoms like fever, acute pneumonia, and, eventually, respiratory 
failure. The death rate, the long time needed for a full recovery, and the co-morbidity associated with 
viral  infection  (i.e.,  in  advanced  age  or  particular  life stages,  such  as  pregnancy)  result  in  a  major 
threat to global health [2]. 

In this scenario, the need for a cure appears to be extremely urgent. The main strategy against 
the  diffusion  of  viruses  is  represented  by  the  development  of  specific  vaccines.  However,  the 
complexity of viruses and their ability to mutate and adapt to new host organisms belonging to other 
species has also led to different therapeutic approaches aimed to interfere with the viral life cycle or 
with  processes  essential  for  membrane  fusion  or  replication  [3,4].  Furthermore,  computational 
chemistry represents a fundamental tool in the screening of applicable drugs [5]. The computational 
approach  can  also  represent  a  tool  for  physicians  and  healthcare  professionals  to  operate  a  first 
decision on the best therapy to administrate at first instance. 

Coronaviruses are single-stranded RNA enveloped viruses  [6,7], whose genes encode, among 
others,  for  a  trimeric  structural  spike  protein,  a  homodimeric  cysteine  proteinase  [8],  an  RNA

polymerase, and several nonstructural proteins (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_045512) 
[9]. 

From a phylogenetic point of view, the genetic similarities shared by SARS–CoV-2 and the 2002 
SARS coronavirus strain (SARS–CoV; they both belong to the so-called beta CoV group) and other 
bat-isolated coronaviruses strains have already been underlined, with more than 96% gene identity 
[7,10,11]. The alignment of spike protein and protease showed an analogy in primary sequences of 
more than 75% [6,10] and 96%, respectively [6,12]. 

Proteases and spike proteins are targets of choice for inhibition of SARS and MERS [13–16], and 
several efforts have been made to develop inhibitors of their activities, by using both virtual screening 
or experimental methods [5,15]. 

In this work, we present the results obtained for SARS–CoV-2 spike protein and 3C-like protease 
by molecular docking of several inhibitors originally developed for antiviral therapy against other 
viruses, such as the hepatitis C virus (HCV) and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Thirteen 
proteinase  inhibitors  from  anti-HIV  and  anti-HCV  drugs  were  investigated,  along  with  three 
different compounds for spike protein inhibition. Despite the different viral strains for which these 
drugs were originally developed, we aim to investigate whether they could also have an affinity for 
the SARS–CoV-2. The use of antivirals that are already available in the therapy against the new virus 
would  be  a  huge  advantage  in  the  fight  of  this  battle,  and  a  first  step  can  eventually  arise  from 
bioinformatic analysis, which could provide information about their potential effectiveness. Indeed, 
our in silico data suggest that an effective interaction occurs for some of the tested molecules. 

These results represent a promising starting point for antiviral therapies that are alternative or 

coadjuvant to the vaccination strategy. 

2. Materials and Methods 

2.1. Protein and Antiviral Drugs 

2.1.1. Initial Sequences 

Protein  sequences  were  obtained  from  the  curated  genomic  sequence  deposited  at  the  Gene 
database with ID number NC_045512 and were verified against SARS–CoV (ID: NC_004718.3) [17]: 
the 3C-like protease (ID: YP_009725301.1), the envelope spike protein (ID: YP_009724390.1), the RNA-
dependent  RNA-polymerase  (ID:  YP_009725307.1),  and  the  nucleocapsid  phosphoprotein  (ID: 
YP_009724397.2) were selected.   

The set of antiviral drugs was taken from the Influenza Research Database (fludb.org). Potential 
inhibitors  of  SARS-CoV-2  protease  were  identified  among  all  the  anti-protease  drugs  in  the 
mentioned  database:  Asunaprevir  (DB11586),  Nelfinavir  (DB00220),  Simeprevir  (DB06290), 
Faldaprevir  (DB11808),  Indinavir  (DB00224),  Ritonavir  (DB00503),  Amprenavir  (DB00701), 
Tipranavir  (DB00932),  Atazanavir  (DB01072),  Saquinavir  (DB01232),  Darunavir  (DB01264), 
Fosamprenavir (DB01319), Lopinavir (DB01601). Furthermore, three molecules were chosen for the 
spike protein: Umifenovir (DB13609), Enfuvirtide (DB00109), and Pleconaril (DB05105). 

2.1.2. Compound Three-Dimensional Structures 

The software OpenBabel [18] was used to convert the SMILES code of each molecule into a 3D 
structural  file.  The  three-dimensional  structure  of  Enfuvirtide  was  taken  from  the  available 
crystallographic structure (PDB ID 3h00, chain A).   

2.1.3. Protein Structure Prediction: Homology Modelling 

The  homology  model  was  performed  with  the  iTasser  server  giving  as  input  the  sequences 
obtained from the SARS–CoV-2 genomic sequence. Model structures were energy minimized before 
the docking protocol by performing a short in vacuum 500 step steepest-descent optimization of the 
potential energy using GROMACS tools [19].

2.2. Docking 

3  of  13 

Autodock Vina [20] was used to perform molecular docking of the antiviral drugs onto SARS–
CoV-2 protease and envelope protein. Regarding the protease, residues 41, 46, 140, 142, 145, 163, 166, 
168, 189 were set as flexibles during the binding mode search [21]. About 3C-like protease, the binding 
box was centered on the coordinates of residue Met165, and its volume fully encompassed the whole 
binding pocket. For the spike envelope glycoprotein, the box used for the search of binding modes 
was centered on the position of the center of mass of Val503 side-chain and restrained to the area 
above the extracellular head of the trimeric protein in the pre-fusion conformation. 

3. Results 

In the following paragraphs, we will analyze and discuss the key properties of putative target 
proteins from SARS–CoV-2 in comparison with their homologs from SARS–CoV. We will focus in 
particular  on four proteins: the  main 3C-like  protease, the  spike envelope  glycoprotein,  the  RNA-
dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp), the Nucleocapsid protein. 

3.1. 3C-Like Protease 

3.1.1. Structural Analysis 

The 3C-like protein is the  main protease of SARS-CoV-2. It plays a fundamental role  in RNA 
translation and, thus, as already underlined, is essential for viral replication [12]. In the mature form, 
it  is  found  as  a  dimer.  Each  monomer  is  formed  by  three  structural  pseudo-domains:  domain  I 
(residues 8–101), domain II (residues 102–184), which  share an antiparallel  β-barrel structure, and 
domain  III  (residues  201–303),  which  contains  a  five-fold  antiparallel  -helix  cluster  [22,23].  The 
binding  site  for  substrates  is  located  in  a  cleft  region  between  domains  I  and  II,  and  the  catalytic 
region is formed by the dyad His41-Cys145 that is highly conserved among the coronavirus proteases 
and is also reminiscent of the trypsin-like serine proteases [22].   

Importantly, 3CPro-19 from SARS–CoV-2 shares a high similarity with its SARS–CoV homolog 
[24],  and  only  very  few  residues  are  substituted  with  respect  to  the  SARS  counterpart:  Thr35Val, 
Ala46Ser, Ser94Ala, Lys180Asn, Ala267Ser, Thr285Ala. Most of these residues are distant from the 
protease  active  site  and  are  unlikely  related  to  selectivity  against  this  protease  (Figure  1A). 
Nonetheless, two of these mutations, Lys180Asn and Ala46Ser, are located in the deep hydrophobic 
pocket below the active site and in the loop region flanking the entrance of the active site. Although 
in  the  available  crystallographic  structure,  Lys180Asn  results  to  be  located  too  far  to  directly 
contribute  to  ligand  binding,  its  presence  extends  the  hydrophobic  inner  region.  Conversely,  the 
Ser46 seems to be relatively distant from the His41 active site (11 Å) and may have a role in ligand 
recruitment (Figure 1B).

3.1.2. Docking 

Although  a  crystallographic  structure  of  3Clike  protease  of  SARS-CoV-2  in  complex  with  a 
peptide-like inhibitor (PDB id: 6LU7) was made very recently available in the Protein Data Bank, this 
structure clearly shows a closed binding pocket around the inhibitor. While very useful to identify 
the residues involved in the inhibitory action, this configuration is not very well suited for molecular 
docking as it may limit the effectiveness of the pose searching methods. For this reason, we preferred 
to  model  the  three-dimensional  structure  of  the  protease  using  a  homology  modeling  protocol, 
excluding the complexed covid-19 protease among the target structures. The structure obtained from 
the iTasser server showed a very good alignment score (TM-score 0.993) against the apo structure of 
SARS–CoV main protease (PDB ID: 5B6O). Interestingly, the root-mean-squared deviation (RMSD) 
of the model structure from the available crystallographic structure SARS–CoV-2 protease is as low 
as 1.3 Å, and it is mostly due to differences in the binding pocket and loop conformations. The main 
results  obtained  from  the  docking  protocol  are  shown  in  Table  1.  Protease  drug  recognitions  are 
usually driven by hydrophobic interactions [24,25], and Figure 2 clearly shows how all the four best 
scoring ligands indeed thoroughly fill the hydrophobic pockets that flank the catalytic dyad.

Surprisingly, the well-known HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitor Simeprevir [26] was identified as 
the  best  scoring  drug  with  a  significant  difference  with  respect  to  some  of  the  most  promising 
inhibitors of SARS–CoV-2 protease identified, such as Lopinavir [27] and Nelfinavir [28].

Indinavir; (d) Tipranavir. Hydrophobic residues (Ala, Phe, Leu, Ile, Pro, Tyr, Val, Met, Trp, Gly) are 
colored in cyan. Catalytic residues are colored in green. N, O, C and S atoms are colored in blue, red, 
gray and yellow respectively. 

 

Simeprevir  fully  fills  two  hydrophobic  pockets  flanking  the  catalytic  dyad  His41-Cys145:  the 
macrocyclic compound fits in the pocket formed by residues in the range Phe181–Phe185, while the 
acyl  sulfonamide  cyclopropyl  moiety  points  towards  the  region  encompassing  Leu27,  Pro39,  and 
Val42. This pose induces the opening of the catalytic dyad. Indeed, His41-Cys145 changes from 3 Å, 
in the apo configuration, to 7.3 Å in the inhibited form. Simeprevir binding to SARS–CoV-2 protease 
is also sustained by three hydrogen bonds that anchor the ligand to the binding pocket: two of them 
link the amide backbone of Glu166 and Gly143 to the carbonyl O in the macrocycle and to the acyl 
sulfonamide cyclopropyl moiety, respectively. A third hydrogen bond is formed between the  N of 
the  Asn142  side  chain  and  the  ether  group.  A  detailed  structural  representation  of  the  interacting 
residues  is  shown  in  Figure  3A.  These  findings  may  appear  rather  surprising,  as  the  HCV  main 
protease  shares  very  low  similarity  with  the  SARS–CoV-2  homolog  (7.5%).  Nonetheless,  the  two 
proteases share a very similar topology of the active site except for the hydrophobic loop Phe181–
Phe185 which is structurally absent in the HCV protease (Figure 3B).

CoV-2 protease is evident on the upper side and is absent in HCV homologue. N, O, C and S atoms 
are colored in blue, red, gray and yellow respectively. 

 

3.2. Envelope glycoprotein 

The so-called spike  protein (or  S protein) of SARS–CoV-2 is present within the  envelope as a 
homotrimer, like in the case of other enveloped viruses. Each monomer features an ectodomain, a 
transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail. Inhibitors are typically designed to interact with the 
upper  part  of  the  protein,  to  interfere  with  the  host  membrane  binding,  and  with  the  fusogenic 
activity of the protein.   

3.2.1. Structural Features 

Several experimentally obtained structures for the multimeric conformation of SARS–CoV spike 
protein are available (PDB: 5WRG, 5 × 58, 5XLR). Homology model structure of SARS–CoV-2 spike 
protein  was  obtained  from  the  iTasser  server.  Global  pairwise  sequence  alignment  indicated  that 
SARS–CoV-2 spike protein shares about 76% of its primary sequence with its SARS–CoV homolog 
with  an  overall  similarity  of  87%.  These  few  differences  project  into  a  slightly  different 
negative/positive residue ratio (115/99 in SARS–CoV and 110/103 in SARS–CoV-2) and a slightly less 
acidic pI (5.6 for SARS–CoV, 6.2 for SARS–CoV-2).   

Interestingly, while this work was in progress, the electron microscopy structure of the SARS–
CoV-2  spike  protein  in  its  oligomeric  pre-fusion  inactive  structure  with  a  single  receptor-binding 
domain up  was  made  available  by another  group (PDB id: 6VSB)  [29]. Unfortunately, a thorough 
direct comparison of our model structure with these experimental data is impaired by the different 
global configuration of the two trimeric structures (“down”-inactive vs. “up”-active conformations). 
However, as the experimental structure shows only one monomer in the “up”-state, a comparison 
can be performed in a monomer-based manner. The RMSD between “down”-state monomers in the 
two structures is as low as 1.17 Å for residues with the same secondary structure assignments and 6 
Å overall. It is worth noting here that in the pre-fusion state, the “down” inactive conformation is 
significantly more stable than the “up”-conformations [30–32]. These findings confirm the quality of 
the homology model and its suitability for docking studies. 

Visual inspection of the electrostatic potential of the “down”-inactive conformation of SARS–
CoV-2 spike protein (Figure 4a,b) shows that while the inner part of the protein that is proximal to 
the  viral  envelope  is  negatively  charged,  the  protein  head  is  clearly  characterized  by  a  positive 

 

Viruses 2020, 12, 445

electrostatic potential. This picture is rather different from one from SARS–CoV (Figure 4c,d) and, 
thus, it suggests an important property to which tailor future inhibitors.

as in panel A. (c) Spike envelope protein from SARS-CoV. Same lateral view as in panel (a). (d) Top 
view of the same representation as in panel (c). 

 

3.2.2. Docking 

The docking of three different inhibitors was performed on the spike protein. As the inhibitors 
are expected to block the membrane binding, we limited the docking search region to the area around 
the protein head in its pre-fusion “down” configuration. Moreover, due to the large size of the protein 
and to limit the computational cost, we performed a rigid docking of the inhibitors against the target 
multimeric protein.   

Autodock Vina was used to identify the best binding pose of three different drugs: Umifenovir 

(DB13609), Enfuvirtide (DB00109), and Pleconaril (DB05105). The results are shown in Table 2.   

Interestingly,  upon  binding,  Enfuvirtide  interacts  with  spike  protein  (whose  cap  is  mainly 

positively charged) through its negatively charged amino acids (several glutamate residues).   

As opposed to Enfuvirtide (Figure 5a), which inhibits the viral spike protein action upon host 
membrane by interposing itself and avoiding contact between the protein and the cellular membrane, 
the  other  two  drugs  docked  at  the  entrance  of  the  central  channel  pore  formed  by  the  trimeric 
structure (Figure 5b,c).

inhibitor in the best five docking poses for Umifenovir (purple) and Pleconavir (green). The receptor-
binding domains (RBD) are indicated by arrows in the middle panel as a reference. 

 

3.3. RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase 

Viral  polymerases  share  seven  highly  conserved  motifs  that  are  essentially  involved  in  the 
nucleotide-binding and catalysis of RNA replication. They are huge, complex structures, which act 
in association with several non-structural proteins [33].   

3.3.1. Structural Properties 

Global pairwise sequence between SARS–CoV-2 RdRp and its SARS–CoV counterpart shows a 
large sequence identity shared by the two proteins (94%) with also a very high similarity (96%). The 
analysis of RdRp and RNA primer complex displays that the RNA-interacting residues are conserved 
between SARS–CoV and SARS–CoV-2 (in red in Figure 6a).

3.4. Nucleocapsid Protein 

The  viral  nucleocapsid  protein  (N  protein)  interacts  with  the  viral  genome  and  forms  the 
ribonucleoprotein  core.  It  is  now  well-known  that  this  protein  plays  different  roles  in  the  viral 
infection, as it is involved in the synthesis of viral RNA, in the transcription of genomic RNA, and in 
the translation of viral proteins [34]. 

Coronavirus nucleocapsid proteins share a general structural pattern composed of three distinct 
domains: an N-terminal domain (~130 residues), which is suggested to bind RNA, a central domain 
(~120 residues), which is also predicted to recognize RNA, and finally the C-terminal domain, which 
drives  the  protein  dimerization.  Although  a  complete  structure  of  the  nucleocapsid  protein  is  not 
available for SARS–CoV, a local structural comparison can be performed by structure superposition 
of  SARS–CoV-2  model  structure  with  N-terminal  and  central  domain  in  the  SARS  counterparts 
(Figure 7). Sequence pairwise alignment of SARS–CoV-2 N protein against its SARS–CoV homolog 
shows a very high identity in primary structure (91%), with an overall similarity of 94%.

RdRp (in red, PDB ID: 2GIB). 

4. Discussion   

The  modeling  and  superimposition  of  protease  structure  with  the  homologous  SARS  virus 
protease show very little differences, although pivotal for the function. The few residues different in 
SARS–CoV-2 protease assimilate the protein to a sort of site-directed mutant of SARS protease (Figure 
1).  The  spike  protein  structure  shows  an  upper,  trimeric  cap  supported  by  a  stem  domain,  with 
remarkable differences in terms of charge, with a mainly positive ectodomain and a strongly negative 
stem domain (Figure 4).   

In  this  respect,  stimulated  by  the  important  results  in  clinical  trials  of  patients  treated  with 
antiretroviral agents [35,36], we extended the investigation by a computational inspection of many 
different drugs, and we chose a selection of most  common antiviral drugs to display the probable 
molecular reasons of their efficacy in combined antiviral therapy. The drugs examined include the 
HIV-1 protease inhibitors, mostly used in combination with other antiviral drugs in the treatment of 
HIV in both adults and children.  Moreover, other antiviral drugs included in our  screening show 
activity against the hepatitis C virus and good oral bioavailability. 

One of the antiviral drugs tested against SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein is Enfuvirtide, an HIV 
fusion inhibitor used in combination therapy for the treatment of HIV-1 infection [37]. The second 
molecule tested  is Umifenovir, an antiviral agent with activity against Influenza A- and B-viruses 
[38]. The last one is Pleconaril [39], used for prevention of asthma exacerbations and common cold 
symptoms  in  asthmatic  subjects  exposed  to  respiratory  infections;  Pleconaril  is  orally  bioavailable 
and active against Picornaviridae viruses. 

The  docking  shows  that  5  out  of  the  13  protease  inhibitors  are  reported  with  a  high-score  in 
thermodynamic terms of a protein–drug complex [20] (Table 1), and may be selected as the future 
core of new antiviral drugs specific for SARS–CoV-2 protease.   

Intriguingly, the docking of the spike protein shows interesting results for all the three drugs 
tested. Notably, Enfuvirtide is placed at the interface of two monomers; in this position, the molecule 
could impair the transition between closed and open state (Figure 4).   

Finally, it is worth mentioning that, currently, some of the drugs reported in Table 1 are used 

with satisfying results in therapies for the treatment of SARS–CoV-2. 

The RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) is one of the most important proteins involved 
in  the  genetic  information  replication  and  transmission  of  the  coronavirus  family  viruses.  The 
function is accomplished by a multimeric complex of RdRp with non-structural proteins favoring a 
sort of “wrapping-and-scrolling” of the viral genome. The RdRp is very similar to the homologous of 
SARS (Figure 6). 

The N-protein promotes the package of viral genome into a helical ribonucleocapsid and virion 
assembly, also interacting with membrane protein. Consequently, N-protein plays an important role 
in viral RNA transcription, as well as viral replication. The dimerization domains of SARS–CoV and 
SARS–CoV-2 share a high similarity (Figure 7). 

The  differences  at  protein  structure  level  with  the  SARS,  the  closest  phylogenetic  virus,  are 
intriguing  and  contribute  to  characterize  the  peculiarity  of  SARS-CoV-2  from  coronavirus  and 
influenza virus belonging to an old-scenario of virology taxonomy. 

It  is  worth  mentioning  that  several  other  groups  are working  on  antiviral-based  strategies  to 
fight the new, big threat represented by SARS–CoV2; in some cases, patients were treated with some 
of the molecules chosen for our studies, i.e., Ritonavir, Lopinavir, Umifenovir [27,40–42]: these data 
strongly support and corroborate the results of our work. 

5. Conclusions 

 

Until now, the exacerbation of COVID-19 diffusion has stimulated the researchers and medical 
personnel to find a solution for the treatment compatible with the arsenal of antiviral drugs currently 
available.

At the same time in which we are closing the present manuscript, the numbers are more than 
81,000  confirmed  cases,  around  3000  deaths,  and  a  sensible  increase  of  recovered  people  (30,000) 
according  to  the  Coronavirus  COVID-19  Global  Cases  by  Johns  Hopkins  CSSE  interactive  map 
(updated  on  14th  of  April  with  more  than  1.9  milion  of  confirmed  cases  and  about  120  thousands 
deaths reported). The first line strategy of isolation, dramatic quarantine measurements, and clinical 
treatments may be a reasonable positive warrant to limit the spread of the virus.   

The  four  proteins  taken  into  account  are  interesting  molecular  targets  for  the  medicinal 

chemistry, mainly the protease and the envelope (or spike) protein.   

The antiviral drug therapy is an effective first-stage approach for treating COVID-19 infections, 
and  the  present  work  could  contribute  to  suggest  to  physicians  the  choice  of  the  combination  of 
antivirals to administer to patients alongside the hospitalization. Obviously, our knowledge in terms 
of  the  general  organization  of  the  structure  of  the  virus  particle  is  limited  now,  but  proteins  like 
protease and spike  are the primary molecular  targets for  drug discovery and development.  In the 
near future, the availability of X-ray crystal structures of the majority of proteins will allow a more 
exhaustive docking calculation on different classes of drugs (e.g., antiparasitic drugs, peptides). The 
structural  and  computational  studies  and  analysis  are  not  subordinate  but  helpful  for  the 
comprehension  of  virus  molecular  elements  and  the  right  way  to  help  the  scientific  community 
during the long process leading to developing a vaccine.
