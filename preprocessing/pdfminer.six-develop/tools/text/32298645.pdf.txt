Based   on   available   reports   (up   to   the   writing   of   this   edito-
rial)   and   on   scientiﬁc   data   reported   by   China,   Italy,   and   the
United   States,   newborn   infants   appear   to   be   signiﬁcantly
less   affected   by   COVID-19   than   adults.1---3 However,   the   lack
of   high-quality   evidence   for   this   situation   and   the   steadfast
pace   of   new   and   conﬂicting   information   has   been   an   over-
all   challenge   to   all   medical   specialties,   including   neonatal
intensive   care.   In   reality,   the   current   knowledge   on   neonatal
severe   acute   respiratory   syndrome   coronavirus   2   (SARS-CoV-
2)   infection   is   limited.   Therefore,   several   questions   remain
unanswered,   while   at   the   same   time   the   neonatal   commu-
nity   needs   to   take   action.   Not   surprisingly,   this   has   caused
signiﬁcant   stress   amongst   neonatal   health   care   providers.

All   over   the   world,   a   number   of   important   groups   have
been   diligently   working   on   the   development   of   protocols

and   guidelines   for   the   neonatal   COVID-19   outbreak.4---7 In
Brazil,   a   signiﬁcant   number   of   documents   on   this   subject
have   been   rapidly   produced   by   national   entities   such   as   the
Brazilian   Society   of   Pediatrics,   the   Ministry   of   Health,   and
the   Neonatal   Resuscitation   Program.8---11 Undoubtedly,   these
are   critical   and   paramount   steps   in   the   ﬁght   against   the   out-
break,   but   given   the   constant   updating   and   some   conﬂicting
information,   health   care   providers   are   facing   difﬁculties   in
determining   best   local   guidelines.   To   make   things   even   more
challenging,   daily   (and   often   non-scientiﬁc)   news   is   released
by   the   press.

What’s   known   about   neonatal   COVID-19   infection?  
It
is   not   yet   established   whether   COVID-19   has   transpla-
cental   or   vertical   transmission.   Recently,   a   report   from
China   described   three  
infants   with   elevated   serum   lev-
els   of  
for   SARS-CoV-2   after
birth.12,13 The   postnatal   courses   were   benign   and   quan-
titative   reverse   transcriptase-polymerase   chain   reaction
(RT-PCR)   from   nasopharyngeal   swabs,   serum,   vaginal   secre-
tions,   and   maternal   breast   milk   were   negative.   Thus,   in   the
light   of   negative   RT-PCR   results   and   given   that   IgM   false   pos-
itives   results   are   not   uncommon,   and   that   the   decline   of   IGM
levels   were   very   unusual   in   comparison   with   other   congenital

infections,   the   possibility   of   maternal-infant   transmission   is
difﬁcult   to   ascertain.14 Fetal   outcomes   may   depend   more   on
the   severity   of   the   maternal   infection   and/or   concomitant
obstetric   diseases,   rather   than   on   a   putative   transmission   of
the   COVID-19   from   the   pregnant   mother   to   the   fetus.15 At
this   point,   very   few   positive   conﬁrmed   neonatal   COVID-19
cases   have   been   reported   in   scientiﬁc   journals,   and   all   of
them   had   no   symptoms   or   very   mild   to   moderate   symptoms,
with   no   fatal   cases   reported   in   infants   <28   days.1---3,16---19
Acquisition   of   COVID-19   has   been   so   far   attributed   to   hori-
zontal   transmission   from   an   infected   mother   or   health   care
provider,   rather   than   vertical.   Based   on   this   limited   evi-
dence,   no   speciﬁc   clinical   picture   for   neonatal   COVID-19
infection   has   consistently   emerged.   Indeed,   a   few   positive
cases   of   neonatal   COVID-19   in   Brazil   have   been   very   recently
reported   by   the   news   or   personal   communications,   and   clin-
ical   presentations   and   neonatal   courses   were   reassuringly
similar   to   the   reported   cases.   Nevertheless,   as   the   disease
continues   to   spread   throughout   the   world,   we   must   remain
vigilant.

What   should   neonatal   health   care   providers   do   about
COVID-19?   First,   all   aspects   involved   in   neonatal   care   (inten-
sive   or   not)   must   be   re-evaluated   in   the   context   of   the
pandemic.   Normal   newborn   nurseries,   neonatal   units   of
intermediate-level   care,   and   neonatal   intensive   care   units
(NICUs)   must   be   prepared   and   adopt   practices   that   follow
the   best   available   evidence   for   the   outbreak.   This   effort
involves   guidelines   for   the   following:   organization   of   unit
space   and/or   isolation   rooms   or   special   areas   for   suspected
or   conﬁrmed   cases,   policies   for   visitation   by   parents   and
family,   and   adoption   of   personal   protective   equipment   (PPE)
during   delivery   of   a   suspected   or   positive   COVID-19   mother
or   during   neonatal   care.   Moreover,   clear   guidelines   are
needed   for   all   types   of   procedures   in   the   delivery   room   or
during   the   hospital   stay,   such   as   cord   clamping,   cleaning   of
secretions,   suction   of   airways   and   stomach,   use   of   all   the
different   types   of   respiratory   support,   breastfeeding,   oper-
ational   protocols   for   in-hospital   transport   (to   radiology   or
operating   rooms),   transport   of   outborn   neonates,   and   selec-
tion/scheduling   of   cases   that   should   be   tested.

What   should   be   done   for   the   overall   care   after   birth?
Clinical   conditions   of   mother   and   newborn   will   determine
the   care   after   birth.   If   the   mother   has   suspected   or   con-
ﬁrmed   COVID-19,   both   are   stable,   and   the   infant   is   not
preterm,   neonatal   health   care   providers   must   offer   orien-
tations   regarding   precautions   to   avoid   spreading   the   virus,
including   washing   of   the   mother’s   hands   before   touching   the
infant,   using   a   face   mask   while   breastfeeding,   and   staying   in
isolated   rooming-in.   However,   if   the   mother   or   the   newborn
are   sick   they   should   stay   separated,   while   considering   the
mother’s   intention   to   breastfeed   by   expressing   breast   milk,
limiting   visits,   and   maintaining   adequate   isolation   measures
during   the   hospital   stay.20 Neonates   positive   for   COVID-
19   must   be   isolated   and   clinically   monitored,   in   order   to
prevent   outbreaks   in   the   NICU.   Owing   to   the   absence   of   evi-
dence   for   vertical   transmission,   as   well   as   for   transmission
through   breast   milk,   most   scientiﬁc   organizations   are   rec-
ommending   not   to   separate   mothers   and   neonates,   with   the
aim   of   promoting   breastfeeding   and   neonatal   bonding,   with
the   exception   of   cases   with   severely   symptomatic   mothers
---   in   such   cases,   barrier   measures   are   suggested,   as   well   as
administration   of   expressed   maternal   milk.21

What   to   do   when   neonatal   respiratory   care   is   needed?
Important   questions   related   to   respiratory   management   dur-
ing   the   immediate   postpartum   period   of   infants   born   from
suspected   or   positive   COVID-19   mothers,   and   the   necessary
protection   that   health   care   providers   should   use,   have   been
addressed.22 Also,   questions   have   been   raised   about   what
forms   of   respiratory   support   can   be   safely   used   in   the   NICU
in   infants   admitted   with   suspected   or   conﬁrmed   COVID-19,
or   who   became   positive   during   hospitalization.

 

very

Can   we   continue   to   use   current   respiratory   strategies?
Yes,   with   a   few   suggested   modiﬁcations   to   address   the   pos-
sibility   of   aerosol   generation   and   exhaled   air   dispersion
during   oxygen   administration   and   ventilatory   support.23,24
Of   note,   a   systematic   review   published   in   2014   by   the   World
Health   Organization   (WHO)   graded   the   evidence   for   using
precautions   against   aerosol   generation   and   exhaled   air   dis-
low,  with   no   studies   evaluating   neonates.25
persion   as  
Based   on   engineering   data   using   adult   models,   the   like-
lihood   of   signiﬁcant   aerosol   generation   and   air   dispersion
during   bag   and   mask   ventilation,   continuous   positive   airway
pressure,   nasal   intermittent   positive   pressure   ventilation,
high   ﬂow   nasal   cannula   therapy,   endotracheal   intubation,
and   invasive   mechanical   ventilation   is   quite   low,   but   not
negligible.26---28 Given   the   lack   of   strong   and   clear   scientiﬁc
evidence   during   this   pandemic,   and   until   more   information
becomes   available,   health   care   providers   should   use   full
PPE   during   respiratory   care   of   infants   with   suspected   or
conﬁrmed   cases.   This   should   include   gloves,   a   long-sleeved
gown,   eye   protection,   and   a   N95   mask   or   the   equivalent.
Also,   it   is   recommended   that   infants   with   suspected   or
positive   COVID-19   infection   should   be   treated   in   negative
pressure   rooms   or   isolated   using   a   2-m   distance   between
incubators   in   open   plan   NICUs.

Two   ﬁnal   points   deserve   special   attention:  

immedi-
ate   endotracheal  
intubation   and   use   of   bacterial/viral
ﬁlters.   There   is   no   evidence   that   neonates   need   to   be
immediately   intubated   in   case   of   respiratory   deterioration
solely   because   of   COVID-19   infection.   First,   because   the
pathophysiology   of   the   disease   is   different,   no   cases   of
neonatal   SARS-CoV-2   infection   have   been   documented.   Sec-
ond,   mechanical   ventilation-associated   lung   injury   is   clearly
an   issue   when   dealing   with   neonatal   lungs.29 Third,   data
coming   from   adults   suggests   that   endotracheal   intubation
is   the   major   aerosol   generating   procedure   and   should   not
be   performed   prophylactically.23,24 Fourth,   during   previous
viral   epidemics   a   number   of   adults   were   successfully   treated
with   non-invasive   respiratory   support   without   any   evidence
of   increased   contamination   or   aerosol   dispersion.23 Thus,
the   only   recommended   modiﬁcation   for   contemporary   respi-
ratory   care   is   the   use   of   bacterial/viral   hydrophobic   ﬁlters
located   at   the   expiratory   part   of   the   systems.   Any   strat-
egy   in   such   neonates   should   be   tailored   to   the   individual
patient,   rather   than   to   the   disease.   This   has   already   been
clearly   outlined   by   the   Brazilian   Pediatric   Society   and   the
national   Neonatal   Resuscitation   Program.8,9 It   is   important
to   highlight   that   the   addition   of   a   ﬁlter,   although   effec-
tive   in   decreasing   viral   dispersion,   adds   dead   space   and
increases   system   resistance,   which   could   be   harmful   to
preterm   infants   if   left   in   place   for   long   periods.   There-
fore,   when   using   these   ﬁlters,   health   care   providers   should
be   mindful   of   the   potential   complications   and   monitor   the
infants   closely.   Also,   in   infants   receiving   bubble   continuous

positive   airway   pressure   (CPAP),   ﬁlters   may   also   increase
system   resistance,   and   spot   checks   of   the   pressure   can   guar-
antee   safe   application.

This   editorial   reﬂects   the   current   knowledge   on   neonatal
COVID-19,   but   as   the   outbreak   and   information   are   changing
rapidly,   continuing   to   watch   for   updates   is   highly   recom-
mended.
