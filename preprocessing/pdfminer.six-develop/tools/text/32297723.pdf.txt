Abstract 

With  each  passing  day,  more  cases  of  Coronavirus  disease
(COVID-2019)  are  being  detected  and  unfortunately  the  fear  of
novel corona virus 2019 (2019-nCoV) becoming a pandemic dis-
ease  has  come  true.  Constant  efforts  at  individual,  national,  and
international  level  are  being  made  in  order  to  understand  the
genomics, hosts, modes of transmission and epidemiological link
of nCoV-2019. As of now, whole genome sequence of the newly
discovered coronavirus has already been decoded. Genomic char-
acterization  nCoV-2019  have  shown  close  homology  with  bat-
derived  severe  acute  respiratory  syndrome  (SARS)-like  coron-
aviruses,  bat-SL-CoVZC45  and  bat-SL-CoVZXC21.  Structural
analysis  of  the  receptor  binding  site  has  confirmed  that  2019-
nCoV  binds  with  the  same  ACE  2  receptor  protein  as  human
SARS virus. Compared to the previous coronavirus outbreaks, the
overall mortality rate is relatively low for COVID-2019 (2-3%).
Suspected cases must be quarantined till their test comes positive
or  they  clear  infection. At  present,  treatment  of  COVID-2019  is
mostly based on the knowledge gained from the SARS and MERS
outbreaks. Remdesivir, originally develop as a treatment for Ebola

virus disease and Marburg virus infections, is being studied for its
effectiveness  against  2019-nCoV  infection.  Many  other  antiviral
agents and vaccines are being tested but most of them are in phase
I or II and hence unlikely to be of any benefit immediately with
regards to current outbreak. Hence, the standard infection control
techniques and preventive steps for healthy individuals and sup-
portive care for the confirmed cases is the best available strategy
to deal with current viral outbreak.

Introduction 

A novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 has recently been detected
(December 2019) amid an outbreak of a cluster of cases of pneu-
monia of unknown etiology in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.
Within next 8-12 weeks, it has spread globally to the extent that
World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  declared  it  as  a  global  pan-
demic on March 11, 2020. In addition to China, as of 14th March
2020, this pandemic has involved more than 150 countries, with a
predominant disease load in Italy, South Korea, Iran, Hong Kong,
Macau,  and  Vietnam. A  significant  number  of  deaths  have  been
reported  in  old  individuals  and  in  patients  with  multiple  comor-
bidities  [1].  With  so  much  concern  and  attention  surrounding
SARS-CoV-2,  knowledge  of  key  clinical  information  and  recent
developments is of extreme importance both as a patient and as a
health care provider.

Fact and figures related to COVID-19

From  December  2019  till  today,  many  countries  worldwide
have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. As of 14th March
2020, data shows 155,845 confirmed COVID-19 cases with 5,814
deaths  worldwide.  Currently,  there  are  75,593  active  infected
cases, 8% (5,908) out of that are critically ill. The early few weeks
of this outbreak saw China (80,824 cases) as having the major bur-
den of the disease. Very soon, countries like, Italy (21,157 cases),
Iran (12,729) and South Korea (8,086 cases) became the worst-hit
countries outside mainland China (Figure 1). Now the number of
cases is growing up even due to the 3rd and 4th generation trans-
missions which signifies that the disease burden is likely going to
increase further in coming few weeks.

COVID-19 fatality rate by sex

Although,  we  do  not  have  any  concrete  data,  but  as  per  the
WHO-China  Joint  Mission  statement dated  28  February  2020,
there has been a trend showing more males dying to COVID-19
than females (4.7% vs 2.8%) [2]. However, this data needs to be
cautiously interpreted because in China, smoking behavior is more

                          [Monaldi Archives for Chest Disease 2020; 90:1292]                                          [page 197]

commonly seen in the males thereby having more respiratory ill-
nesses and complications. 

COVID-19 fatality rate by age

Older  individuals  are  especially  at  higher  risk  of  dying  from
COVID-19  as  compared  to  younger  population. The  fatality  rate
significantly worsens in the individuals of more than 60 yrs (3.6%)
as compared to individuals younger than 40 yrs (0.2%). 

COVID-19 fatality rate by comorbidities

Patients who had no pre-existing comorbidities were reported
to have a low case fatality rate (~0.9%). As, also commonly seen
in  many  other  illnesses,  pre-existing  medical  condition  increases
the  risk  of  dying  due  to  COVID-19  [3-5].  When  compared  with
Wang et al.’s cohort, Huang et al.’s patient population was compar-
atively  younger  (median  age  of  49  versus 56  years)  and  with  a
lower  fatality  rate  (3%  vs 4.3%).  Both  studies  showed  hyperten-
sion,  diabetes  mellitus,  and  cardiovascular  disorders  as  the  most
common underlying comorbidities in COVID-19 patients. As per
the WHO-China Joint Mission statement (dated 28 February 2020)
[2], a risk of dying of a confirmed COVID-19 patient is highest by
having  cardiovascular  disease  (13.2%),  diabetes  mellitus  (9.2%),
hypertension  (8.4%),  and  chronic  respiratory  disease  (8%)  in
decreasing order. 

Basic (R0) and effective reproduction number (R)
of SAR-CoV-2

The  basic  reproduction  number  (R0)  is  a  useful  predictor  that
measures the transmission capability of a disease. It is defined as an
average number of secondary infections produced by one case in a
population considering everyone is susceptible. However, in a prac-
tical world, it is rare to have a population to be completely suscepti-
ble to a given infection due to the presence of immune individuals as
well. In order to successfully wipe out a disease, R should go down

below 1. With regards to SARS-CoV-2, there has been a substantial
variation in reporting of transmission rates over time [6,7]. Liu et al.
recently reviewed 12 studies on R0 for COVID-19 and found that
the major reason for the difference in reported R0 is probably due to
the various estimation methods used While analyzing the results [8].
They found that the studies using mathematical methods estimated a
higher average R0 of 4.2 (range: 1.5 to 6.49) [9-13]. A reasonably
comparable R0 was found with studies using stochastic (average R0-
2.44,  range:  2.2–2.68)  and  statistical  methods  (average  R0-  2.67,
range: 2.2 to 3.58) [6,14-16].

Virology and epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2

Taxonomy

In general, coronaviruses are abundant in birds and mammals
and constitute a big family of non-segmented, enveloped, positive-
sense, single-stranded RNA viruses [17]. Amongst these, bats are
believed  to  be  the  home  to  the  greatest  variety  of  genotypes.
Combined, animal and human coronaviruses fall into four genera
namely alpha coronavirus, beta coronavirus, gamma coronavirus,
and  delta  coronavirus  genus.  The  Middle  East  respiratory  syn-
drome (MERS),  Severe acute respiratory syndrome  (SARS),  and
SARS-CoV-2 all three belong to beta coronavirus genus.

Virus receptor-binding domain-Human ACE-2 receptor
interaction

Atomic-level of understanding of SARS-CoV-2 and its interac-
tion with human cells has considerably clarified the pathogenesis
of COVID-19 disease at a molecule are level. Scientists have suc-
ceeded  in  recognizing  the  receptor  i.e.  ACE-2  receptor  for  the
attachment  of  SARS-CoV-2.  Wan  et  al.  from  the  college  of
Veterinary Medicine, Minnesota studied the complex interaction of

Review

Definitive and intermediate hosts

Like the previous coronavirus outbreaks, there is enough evi-
dence now that the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandem-
ic has a hidden reservoir in the wild animals and possibly there
were accidental spillover to human population leading to this out-
break (Figure 2) [30,31]. Phylogenetic analysis and virus genome
analysis  with  annotation  have  shown  that  coding  regions  of
SARS-CoV-2  possess  a  similar  genomic  structure  to  bat-SL-
CoVZC45, bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and SARS-CoV [32]. Paraskevis
et  al.  also  did  a  complete  genome  evolutionary  analysis  of  the
SARS-CoV-2  and  confirmed  similar  findings  with  96.3%
the  BatCoV  RaTG13  sequence.
sequence  similarity 
Interestingly, they also found evidence of discordant clustering in
SARS-CoV-2  with  the  Bat  SARS-like  coronavirus  sequences.
They concluded saying SARS-CoV-2 likely originated from bats
but  rejected  the  possibility  of  this  outbreak  as  a  result  of  any
recent recombination event [33]. Hence, while the exotic animals
are the definitive hosts, humans and domestic animals get acci-
dentally exposed to wild animals during their intentional or unin-
tentional exposure and interaction with them.

Clinical presentation

Asymptomatic infections

During the initial days of outbreak, only the symptomatic indi-
viduals, were thought to be infectious and capable of transmitting
the  infection.  However  very  soon,  convincing  studies  came  up
which  suggested  that  asymptomatic  individuals  could  potentially
also  be  transmitting  the  infection.  Hu  et  al.  studied  the  clinical

SARS-CoV-2  receptor-binding  domain  (RBD)  with  the  ACE-2
receptor. Based on their structure-function protective framework,
they concluded that ACE-2 receptor for SARS-CoV-2 is the same
as for the SARS virus responsible 2003-2004 outbreak [18]. They
studied various virus binding hot spots on human ACE 2 receptors
and compared with orthologues isolated from other species. They
found that amino acids located at 442, 472, 479, 480 and 487 posi-
tions  enhance  the  viral  binding  capacity  to  the  human  ACE-2
receptors.  Similarly,  a  single  mutation  N501T  was  found  to
enhance  the  interaction  between  SARS-CoV-2-RBD  with  the
ACE-2 receptor. Data suggests that SARS-CoV-2 binds to human
ACE 2 receptors even more efficiently than the SARS-CoV-2003
strain but less efficiently than the SARS-CoV-2002 strain. Similar
studies are underway with the long-term goal of understanding epi-
demiological link, identifying the potential definite and intermedi-
ate hosts, and predicting the species-specific interactions and sus-
ceptibility to these viral infections.

Incubation period

According  to  the  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention
(CDC), the mean incubation period of COVID-2019 is approximate-
ly 5.1 days (range 2-14 days). Lauer et al. did a pooled analysis of
181 confirmed COVID-19 cases from China [19]. They estimated the
median  incubation  period  of  COVID-19  to  be  5.1  days. The  study
showed that 95% of patients had incubation period ranging from 2.1
(CI, 1.5 to 3.2) to 14.7 (CI, 7.4 to 22.6) days. These numbers justify
the  quarantine  period  of  14  days  set  by  the  World  Health
Organization (WHO). It is important to understand that for any com-
municable disease, latent period and incubation period are two differ-
ent entities affecting the transmission dynamics. Based on the discus-
sion by Lauer et al., it is very much possible that the latency period
of COVID-19 may be less than its incubation period there by mean-
ing, people may be contagious even before being symptomatic [19].

Mode of transmission

It is easy to understand the concept of being symptomatic and
contagious to transmit a pathogen to healthy individuals in case of a
communicable  disease  [20].  However,  now  there  are  recent  evi-
dences  of  SARS-CoV-2  transmission  by  even  minimally  sympto-
matic or asymptomatic individuals [21,22]. As of now, the routes of
SARS-CoV-2 transmission seems to be diversified. Major transmis-
sion routes are through close or direct contact with infected secre-
tions or large aerosol droplets [23]. There is a growing concern over
the possibility of the role of fecal-oral transmission in COVID(cid:0)19
transmission  [24,25]. The  obvious  logic  behind  this  speculation  is
the fact that ACE-2 receptor protein is also found in abundance in
the  epithelia  of  intestinal  lumen.  Also,  Zhang  et  al.  from  Wuhan
University detected the SARS-CoV-2 viral nucleic acids in the fecal
samples and anal swabs of COVID(cid:0)19 patients [24]. The brighter
side is that as compared to MERS and SARS, patients with COVID-
19  have  reported  lesser  gastrointestinal  symptoms-diarrhea
(2(cid:0)10.1%), and nausea and vomiting (1(cid:0)3.6%). Fecal-oral route is
known  to  be  responsible  for  many  endemic  diseases  especially  in
developing  countries  [26].  The  exact  significance  of  gut–lung
crosstalk and the role of gut microbiota in COVID-19 is yet to be
determined. Hence, more definitive evidence is required before we
can say that targeting gut microbiota would fetch as a new therapeu-
tic option. With regards to vertical transmission in pregnant woman
from  mother  to  baby,  none  of  the  studies  conducted  so  far  on
COVID-19 affected pregnancies have shown any evidence of verti-
cal  transmission,  viral  shedding  in  the  vaginal  secretions,  or  evi-
dence of SARS-CoV-2 in breast milk [27-29].

characteristics  of  24  asymptomatic  individuals  who  were  found
positive for SARS-CoV-2 while screening for COVID-19 [34]. At
follow  up,  only  five  individuals  (20.8%)  developed  symptoms
(fever, cough, fatigue, etc.). 70.8 % of individuals had CT imaging
shadows  (twelve  reported  typical  GGOs,  five  reported  as  stripe
shadowing in the lungs). These results underscored the importance
of close contact tracking and lengthwise reconnaissance via appro-
priate virus nucleic acid tests.

Symptomatic patients

Data  on  clinical  presentation  of  the  SARS-CoV-2  outbreak  is
rapidly evolving. The commonly reported symptoms as per the ear-
lier studies were predominantly related to the respiratory system like
fever, dry cough, fatigue, and myalgia [4,5]. Non-respiratory symp-
toms like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea were uncommon presenta-
tions.  Unfortunately,  there  are  no  pathognomonic  clinical  features
that  could  confidently  differentiate  COVID-19  from  other  routine
viral respiratory infections [35,36]. The problem seems to be wors-
ening as we are moving away from 1st/2nd generation transmissions
to 3rd and 4th generation transmissions. As per the study by Chen et
al  on  89  COVID-19  patients  from Wuhan,  the  patients  presenting
before 23rd January 2020 had more systemic symptoms and produc-
tive cough as compared to the patients admitted after 23rd January
2020 [37]. This indicates that, the pattern of symptomatology is also
evolving gradually with time and hence we should be watchful for
this change in symptomatology pattern so that the screening criteria
can be changed if required.

Investigations 

A  diagnostic  test  capable  of  rapid  and  accurate  detection  of
SARS-CoV-2 is the need of the hour due to the enormous spread
of pandemic and increasing number of COVID-19 patients. With
regards  to  the  United  States,  any  suspected  patient  should  be
reported  immediately  to  appointed  infection-control  authority  at
the local health center and then to the local or state health depart-
ment. Currently, in the United States, CDC is the only center where
the diagnostic testing can be conducted officially. Once the State
health  department  receives  a  call  from  any  Medical  Center,  it  is
required  to  immediately  contact  CDC’s  Emergency  Operations
Center (EOC) at 770-488-7100 who will then assist with the col-
lection, storage, and shipment of the clinical specimens.

Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR)

As  per  CDC  guidelines,  a  reverse-transcription  polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) test is the current standard of test to con-
firm COVID-2019. However, RT-PCR has also its own challenges
like  i)  delay  in  result  turnaround  time,  and  ii)  interpreting  the
results. Another  major  hurdle  is  the  dynamic  conversion  of  RT-
PCR  results  from  either  negative  to  positive  or  from  positive  to
negative. Hence, combining RT-PCR with other investigation like
computed tomography (CT) of the chest in an appropriate clinical
setting is the best modality to investigate any patient. Ai et al. in
their recent study suggested a higher sensitivity of CT chest (98%)
than RT-PCR (71%) in diagnosing COVID-2019 [38].

Choosing the right specimen

COVID-19 disease is new for everyone and hence with each
passing  day,  more  information  is  pouring  in  with  regards  to  the
diagnostic approach and selecting the best type of specimen to run
the test. Elucidating the diagnostic accuracy of various respiratory
specimens holds a pivotal role in the control, diagnosis, and treat-

ment of COVID-19 disease. Specimens can be collected from the
upper respiratory tract (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs),
lower  respiratory  tract  (sputum,  endotracheal  aspirate,  broncho-
alveolar lavage), serum and urine and stool if possible. 

Collection samples from the lower respiratory tract (usually
BAL)  are  not  feasible  always  in  every  case  due  to  logistic  and
medical reasons. Hence, BAL samples are not a routine laborato-
ry sample available for diagnosis and monitoring of the SARS-
CoV-2. Instead, the collection of samples from the upper respira-
tory  tract  like  a  nasal  swab,  throat  swab  and  sputum  are  rapid,
simple and safe. Yang et al studied a total of 866 samples from 61
respiratory  tracts  of  the  patients  including  nasal  swabs,  throat
swabs,  sputum,  and  62  BAL  fluid  samples. Amongst  the  upper
respiratory  tract  samples,  their  study  showed  a  sputum  sample
having the highest positive rate (74.4-88.9%), followed by nasal
swabs (53.6-73.3%) for both severe and mild cases. They recom-
mended  whenever  available,  monitoring  viral  RNA  titers  in  the
BAL fluids could help in understanding the disease trajectory and
prognosis [39,40].

Also, it is important to remember that the CDC does not rec-
ommend  any  virus  isolation  in  cell  culture  due  to  biosafety  rea-
sons. Few studies have suggested that a COVID-2019 is ruled out
in any case if RT-PCR is negative from respiratory tract samples on
two  consecutive  occasions  which  are  24  hours  apart.  But  as  dis-
cussed above, RT-PCR alone can have a low detection rate [38,41].
Also, to note that all respiratory samples should also be tested for
the usual viruses such as influenza type A, influenza type B, aden-
ovirus, respiratory syncytial virus and so on. 

Computed tomography (CT) of chest

With  many  limitations  of  RT  PCR,  the  role  of  imaging  is
increasingly recognized as a crucial step in diagnosing suspected
cases  of  COVID-19.  When  compared  to  RT-PCR,  CT  imaging
seems to be feasible, easily available and a rapid method. A higher
sensitivity rate of CT scan (97%) than RT PCR (71%) puts CT in
a driving position with regards to COVID-19 diagnosis [38,41]. As
reported  by  most  studies,  the  common  CT  imaging  findings  are
ground-glass opacities (GGOs), consolidation, bilateral/multilobar
involvement, peripheral distribution, round opacities and interlob-
ular  thickening  [4,5,42].  Linear  opacities,  crazy  paving,  and
reverse halo have been also reported as common late findings as
disease  progresses.  In  contrast,  findings  which  are  considered
inconsistent  or  atypical  for  COVID-19  infection  are  tree-in-bud
opacities, centrilobular distribution, peribronchovascular distribu-
tion,  cavitation,  lymphadenopathy,  pleural  effusion  and  predomi-
nant nodular opacities [41].

Laboratory testing

With regards to laboratory workup, the common laboratory stud-
ies are complete blood count, coagulation profile, serum biochemi-
cal tests (including renal and liver function, creatine kinase, lactate
dehydrogenase, and electrolytes), myocardial enzymes, and procal-
citonin.  The  most  common  reported  laboratory  findings  so  far
reported are normal/ low white cell counts, elevated C-reactive pro-
tein  (CRP),  deranged  coagulogram,  and  elevated  lactic  acid  dehy-
drogenase. Zhou et al. reviewed 191 COVID-19 patients and found
that as compared to survivors, the non-survivors had lower baseline
lymphocyte count, which continued to worsen until the day of death
[43].  Similarly,  non-survivors  had  higher  d-dimer,  high-sensitivity
cardiac troponin I, serum ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, and IL-6
values  in  comparison  to  the  survivors.  Similar  results  were  also
reported by Fan et al. who reviewed 69 patients and found that, ICU

Review

requiring  patients  (n=9  cases)  were  comparatively  a  decade  older,
and had significant lymphopenia (p<0.001), significant neutrophilia
(p<0.001),  significant  elevated  LDH  (p<0.005)  and  significantly
lower CD45+, CD3+, CD4+, CD19+, and CD16/56+ counts when
compared with non-ICU patients (n=58 cases) [44]. 

Prevention

To  date,  no  effective  vaccination  is  available.  The  risk  of
acquiring secondary and atypical infections is more so in cases of
immunocompromised individuals [45]. Therefore, the best way in
order to protect oneself is to follow the conventional infection con-
trol protocols and avoid unnecessary travel, public transport, con-
tact with sick people and so on.

Significance of hand washing

The importance of frequent and proper hand hygiene should be
emphasized.  SARS-CoV-2  like  the  other  coronaviruses  have  a
lipid envelope and in simple words, washing with soap can break
that fat in the envelope apart and thereby making it impossible or
difficult for the virus to infect human cells. Hence, handwashing
with soap and water is by far the more powerful weapon than any
other preventive measure. Also, more importantly, the duration of
the soap wash is also equally important. CDC recommends at least
20 seconds of effective engagement in hand washing. In a recent
study on field observations of 3,749 people in a college town envi-
ronment, Borchgrevink et al. found that only about 5% of them fol-
lowed  all  the  rules  of  handwashing  and  only  5%  engaged  them-
selves  in  an  effective  handwashing  technique  (washing,  rubbing,
and  rinsing)  for  more  than  15  seconds  [46].  This  indicates  that,
understanding  of  the  public  regarding  the  importance  of  hand
washing  in  general  is  poor  and  hence  every  attempt  should  be
made  to  reinforce  to  adopt  this  essential  preventive  measure  in
day-to-day practice.

Appropriate use of face mask

Physical barrier in the form of using a face mask by individu-
als  showing  respiratory  symptoms  is  recommended  by  WHO.
Healthy individuals are not advised to use a face mask. A surgical
mask  provides  only  “one-way  protection”  and  prevents  the
spreading of droplets during sneezing and coughing from a wearer
to  the  surrounding  areas  (Figure  3).  In  contrast,  health  care
providers  who  are  taking  care  of  suspected  or  proven  cases  of
COVID-19 must wear a specialized respirator, N95 which techni-
cally is a good fit mask preventing the entry of droplets and there-
by minimizing the chance of acquiring the infection. Considering
the high risk of transmission through direct contact, stringent pre-
cautions should be displayed especially while handling the body
secretions like urine, sputum or stools of the affected patients, and
sewage from hospitals [47]. WHO on 3rd March 2020, released a
statement  requesting  various  industries  and  governments  to
increase the production of personal protective equipment (PPEs)
by  at  least  40%  to  meet  rising  global  demand.  The  shortage  of
PPEs is an immediate threat to the frontline health care providers
endangering their life. 

Treatment

Current standard of care

At present, there is no specific antiviral agent that is approved
for COVID-19. Hence, supportive care to help alleviate symptoms
is the best current approach being followed by all the medical cen-
ters worldwide. Supportive care includes isolating the patient to a
negative  pressure  isolation  room,  and  providing  adequate  rest,
hydration, nutritional support and electrolyte balance. Complicated
cases developing respiratory failure, ARDS, heart failure and sep-
tic shock also require a high level of care and other life support like
invasive  ventilation,  extracorporeal  membrane  oxygenation
(ECMO), renal replacement therapy and so on.

Current stand of antiviral agents

As  mentioned  above,  as  of  now  there  is  no  specific  antiviral
therapy for COVID-19 [48-55]. However, there are antiviral agents
that were found effective during the previous outbreaks of SARS
and  MERS.  Amongst  the  commonly  used  antiviral  agents,  rib-
avirin, interferon, lopinavir-ritonavir, have been used in the past in
patients with SARS or MERS. These antiviral agents are currently
being used either alone or in various combinations by physicians
in  various  medical  centers  worldwide  to  treat  their  COVID-19
cases, although the exact efficacy is still unclear. Hence, substan-
tial efforts are ongoing to find out new therapeutic agents for this
coronavirus  infection.  Hence  whenever  possible,  patients  should
be  enrolled  in  ongoing  randomized  control  trials.  We  encourage
physicians  to  review  the  latest  developments  and  available  evi-
dence  while  considering  using  any  agent  as  anti-SARS-CoV-2
medication. It is also not clear till now whether a single drug ver-
sus a combination of multiple anti-viral agents would be appropri-
ate to treat COVID-19 cases.

Current stand of antibacterial agents

Antibacterial  agents  are  not  to  be  used  empirically.  Only  in
cases where a secondary bacterial infection/pneumonia is suspect-
ed, an antibacterial agent like cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones
should be used after sending blood cultures [56].

Role of corticosteroids

Ideally  speaking,  the  current  stand  of  corticosteroid  use  in
COVID-19 is controversial due to the concern that it may delay the
viral  clearance  from  the  body.  However,  practically  speaking  a
judicial short term use of steroids (methylprednisolone 1-2 mg/kg
body weight per day for 3-5 days) is being used frequently by var-
ious  health  care  centers  worldwide  for  severe  cases  in  order  to
ameliorate lung inflammation to prevent the development of acute
respiratory distress syndrome. 

Use of Traditional Chinese medications

Traditional  Chinese  Medicine  (TCM)  has  been  used  since
ancient  times  to  treat  a  variety  of  disorders  across  the  globe
[57,58].  China’s  National  Health  Commission  and  National
Administration  of  Traditional  Chinese  Medicine  recently  recom-
mended  using  probiotics  in  the  treatment  of  severe  COVID(cid:0)19
[57]. This could possibly maintain a balance of intestinal microe-
cology  and  prevent  secondary  bacterial  infection.  However,  it
should only be used as an ancillary add on therapy in addition to
the mainline treatment strategy.

Newer drugs, vaccines and clinical trials

A coalition of researchers and scientists worldwide are work-
ing relentlessly with an aim to develop an ideal antiviral agent and
vaccine  against  SARS-CoV-2.  In  general,  antiviral  agents  could
belong to be a i) Virus-based therapy like monoclonal antibodies or
antiviral peptides targeting the various molecules, steps or levels of
viral  machinery  like  viral  spike  glycoprotein,  viral  enzyme
inhibitors, and viral nucleic acid synthesis inhibitors, or ii) Host-
based  therapies to  potentiate  the  interferon  response,  affect  host
signaling  pathways,  or  host  factors  utilized  by  SARS-CoV-2  for
replication [52].

There  are  scientists  who  are  also  working  on  the  concept  of
drug repurposing, which is a strategy to generate an additional ben-

efit from an existing drug to target other new diseases [48,49]. For
instance, the concomitant actions of ezetimibe and statins might be
useful for the treatment of several viral infections (NCT00908011,
NCT00099684,  NCT00843661,  NCT03490097,  NCT00994773,
NCT00441493). On similar lines of drug repurposing, Wang et al
recently  studied  ribavirin,  penciclovir,  nitazoxanide,  nafamostat,
chloroquine  and  two  broad-spectrum  antiviral  drugs  Remdesivir
(GS-5734) and favipiravir (T-705) for their efficacy against SARS-
CoV-2  in  vitro.  They  found  that  Remdesivir,  nitazoxanide,  and
chloroquine  were  able  to  block  SARS-CoV-2  infection  at  a  low-
micromolar concentration [51]. Remdesivir is a nucleotide analog
that was originally developed during the Ebola outbreak and has
shown superior antiviral activity to lopinavir (LPV) and Ritonavir
(RTV) [54]. Unfortunately, it is not commercially available and has
been used only on compassionate ground in a patient with COVID-
19 in the United States [53]. In contrast, LPV/RTV combination is
widely available with a predictable toxicity profile but in a recent
18  patient  series  from  Singapore,  5  cases  who  were  treated  with
LPV/RTV combination had variable treatment outcomes and sig-
nificant toxicities of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and hepatotoxicity
[55].  National  Institutes  of  Health  (NIH)  has  initiated  a  clinical
trial  to  test  Remdesivir  for  its  clinical  effectiveness  at  the
University  of  Nebraska  Medical  Center  (UNMC)  in  Omaha
(NCT04280705) [57]. 

Special scenarios: Need of tailored approach

Pregnancy and special needs

Having a disease while being pregnant is a special situation
as now the body has to deal with a physiological stress related to
pregnancy and an additional perturbation due to pathological dis-
ease  [27,59].  The  treatment  of  COVID-19  pregnant  patients  is
more challenging than non-pregnant cases with certain additional
precautions.  The  management  requires  a  multi-disciplinary
approach  including  obstetric-gynecologists,  neonatologists,
intensivists,  infectious  disease  specialists,  and  internists.  If
required, a CT scan of the chest should be performed as the fetal
risk  of  radiation  exposure  is  considered  very  small.  Secondly,
amongst  the  antiviral  agents,  LPV/RTV  combination  is  prefer-
able to use considering their safety profile in pregnancy [60-62].
Ultrasound  examination  for  monitoring  fetal  well-being  is  also
recommended. If a preterm delivery is anticipated, an intramus-
cular  betamethasone  injection  should  be  given  to  ensure  fetal
lung  maturity.  There  is  no  evidence  of  viral  shedding  through
vaginal  secretions  or  vertical  transmission  of  SARS-CoV-2.
Hence  all  patients  if  clinically  stable  should  undergo  vaginal
delivery [27,63]. There are recent reports of post-natal transmis-
sion  of  the  infection  from  diseased  mother  to  the  newborn.
Considering  this,  an  early  cord  clamping  is  recommended.  It  is
recommended to separate the newborn from COVID-2019 infect-
ed mother for at least two weeks. Also, during this period of sep-
aration, breastfeeding is not recommended [27].

Cancer patients and their care

Patients  suffering  from  cancer  are  at  higher  risk  of  acquiring
viral infections like SARS-CoV-2 infection and are likely to develop
more complications [64,65]. Patients with hematological malignan-
cies,  patients  on  active  chemotherapy,  neutropenic  patients,  and
bone  marrow  transplant  patients  are  significantly  at  a  higher  risk
[66]. Almost  all  major  cancer  centers  and  oncology  experts  have

[page 202]                                           [Monaldi Archives for Chest Disease 2020; 90:1292]

Review

issued their respective guidelines and statements for their practicing
oncologists,  nurse  practitioners,  cancer  patients,  and  their  care
providers.

In addition to following the general guidelines of personal and
social etiquettes, cancer patients should take a special precaution like
i) get a few extra refills of the essential medications; ii) discuss with
primary oncologist before making any travel plans; iii) reschedule
all the non-urgent appointments for the later date; iv) discuss with
the primary oncologist about the feasibility of rescheduling/postpon-
ing any maintenance chemotherapy/immunotherapy in an otherwise
well-controlled cancer in remission; v) ensure that oneself is up to
date on a vaccination schedule.

Cardiovascular patients with COVID-19 disease

Most  studies  have  showed  patients  with  cardiovascular  risk
factors  like  advanced  age,  hypertension,  diabetes,  cardiovascular
diseases, cerebrovascular disease had washed clinical outcome [3].
A recent study including 22,000 patients from Italy, reported mor-
tality  of  7.2%.  Cardiovascular  risk  factors  in  term  of  diabetes,
ischemic  heart  disease,  atrial  fibrillation  and  a  history  of  stroke
was  present  in  35.5%,  30%,  24.5%,  and  9.6%  simultaneously
among a subset of patient with mortality. Advanced age was asso-
ciated with higher mortality in this study with a reported case fatal-
ity  of  12.8%,  20.2%  in  patients  above  age  group  of  70  and  80
simultaneously. Across all studies cardiovascular risk factors like
advanced  age,  hypertension,  diabetes,  coronary  artery  disease,
heart failure, atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular disease have been
reported  to  be  associated  with  increased  mortality  [67,68].  As
shown in image one these factors have been independently shown
to be associated with worsening disease severity, bilateral conflu-
ent lung involvement on CT chest  involvement of multiple organs,
requirement  of  invasive  and  noninvasive  ventilation,  presence  of
cardiac injury, and mortality [69-71].

Conclusions 

Our current understanding of COVID-19 is limited and is still
evolving. COVID-19 disease burden has put a lot of pressure on
health resources and patient care. Elimination of COVID-19 is an
international priority because, without control of viral spread, the
disease burden is going to increase every day with increased mor-
tality. Till now, the best proven measures are infection control poli-
cies  of  rigorous  contact  tracing,  stringent  quarantine  of  sympto-
matic  contacts,  and  hospital  isolation  and  screening  of  sympto-
matic cases.
