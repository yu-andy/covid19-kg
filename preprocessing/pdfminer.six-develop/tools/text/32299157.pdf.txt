Prediction  of  COVID-19  transmission  dynamics  using  a  mathematical  model  considering 

behavior changes

Abstract 

Objectives:  Since  the  report  of  the  first  confirmed  case  in  Daegu  on  February  18,  2020,  local 

transmission  of  COVID-19  in  the  Republic  of  Korea  has  continued.  In  this  study,  we  aimed  to 

identify the pattern of  local transmission of COVID-19 using mathematical modeling and predict 

the epidemic size and the timing of the end of the spread.  

Methods:  We  modeled  the  COVID-19  outbreak  in  the  Republic  of  Korea  by  applying  a 

mathematical  model  of  transmission  that  factors  in  behavioral  changes.  We  used  the  Korea 

Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention  data  of  daily  confirmed  cases  in  the  country  to 

estimate  the  nationwide  and  Daegu/Gyeongbuk  area-specific  transmission  rates  as  well  as 

behavioral change parameters using a least-squares method. 

Results:  The  number  of  transmissions  per  infected  patient  was  estimated  to  be  about  10  times 

higher  in  the  Daegu/Gyeongbuk  area  than  the  average  of  nationwide.  Using  these  estimated 

parameters, our models predicts that about 13,800 cases will occur nationwide and 11,400 cases 

in the Daegu/Gyeongbuk area until mid-June. 

Conclusion:  We  mathematically  demonstrate  that  the  relatively  high  per-capita  rate  of 

transmission  and  the  low  rate  of  changes  in  behavior  have  caused  a  large-scale  transmission  of 

COVID-19 in the Daegu/Gyeongbuk area in the Republic of Korea. Since the outbreak is expected 

to continue until May, nonpharmaceutical interventions that can be sustained over the long term 

are required.

In  December  2019,  a  case  of  pneumonia  of  unknown  cause  occurred  in  Wuhan  City,  China  and 

was identified as a novel coronavirus infection in January 2020. Originating from Wuhan City, the 

virus  then  spread  to  every  region  in  China.  Since  the  report  of  the  first  confirmed  case  outside 

China  in  Thailand  on  January  13,  the  virus  has  been  spreading  worldwide.  On  January  30,  the 

World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  declared  the  outbreak  a  public  health  emergency  of 

international concern (1). According to the WHO situation reports No. 48, a total of 53 countries 

so  far,  including  the  Republic  of  Korea,  Italy,  and  Japan  are  showing  community  transmission; 

there have been 80,859 confirmed cases in China and 24,727 confirmed cases outside of China as 

of March 8, 2020 (2).  

In  the  Republic  of  Korea,  after  the  first  confirmed  case  of  COVID-19  on  January  20,  2020,  the 

epidemic has continued to spread. Prior to February 18, most confirmed cases were imported or a 

result  of  transmission  via  close  contact  with  a  confirmed  patient,  but  since  February  18,  local 

transmission  has  led  to  a  spread  throughout  the  entire  nation  following  outbreaks  in  religious 

communities  and  social  welfare  facilities.  On  February  23,  the  Korea  Centers  for  Disease  Control 

and  Prevention  (KCDC)  raised  the  infectious  disease  alert  level  to  “red,”  the  highest  level,  and 

declared that it would implement a  containment policy  including patient detection  and  isolation 

along  with  strategies  to  prevent  and  minimize  local  transmission  (3).  The  government  is  actively 

intervening  by  tracking  and  controlling  those  who  have  been  in  close  contact  and  conducting 

disease  prevention  activities,  while  the  public  is  making  efforts  to  prevent  the  transmission 

through  social  distancing  and  improvements  in  personal  hygiene.  Figure  1  shows  the  infectious 

disease  alert  level  and  nonpharmaceutical  interventions  set  in  place  by  the  government  from 

February 18 to March 10.

We applied a mathematical model that factors in the behavioral changes  that were implemented 

in the population since local transmission began on February 18 to estimate the transmission rate. 

The  model  predicts  the  final  size  and  the  timing  of  the  end  of  the  epidemic  as  well  as  the 

maximum  number  of  isolated  individuals.  While  the  number  of  confirmed  cases  continues  to 

increase nationwide, the number of cases in the Daegu/Gyeongbuk area accounts for about 90% 

of  all  cases  in  the  Republic  of  Korea,  and  the  incidence  rate  per  100,000  population  in  the 

Daegu/Gyeongbuk area, at 132.96 cases on average (Daegu 232.42, Gyeongbuk 41.95), is at least 

nine times higher than the national average of 14.49 (as of March 10, 2020) (4). Our mathematical 

transmission  model, 

therefore,  discriminates  between 

the  national 

level  and 

the 

Daegu/Gyeongbuk  area.  We,  thus,  analyzed  the  pattern  of  COVID-19  local  transmission  in  the 

Republic  of  Korea  by  mathematical  modeling  and  simulations  and  estimated  the  relative  risk  by 

comparing  epidemiological  parameters  between  the  national  level  and  the  Daegu/Gyeongbuk 

area.

Data

Materials and methods 

We  used  the  data  from  the  KCDC  daily  press  releases  (5)  and  the  daily  confirmed  cases  from 

February 18, when the 31st case was confirmed, to March 10. The daily case data from February 

18 to March 1 were updated at 9:00 am, while from March 2, data were updated at 0:00 am. We 

calculated the number of cases by region based on the initially reported cases. As an estimate of 

the total population, we used the resident registration data as of February, 2020, provided by the 

Korean Statistical Information Service (KOSIS) (6).  

Mathematical model 

We constructed a mathematical model of COVID-19 transmission based on the SEIR model with a 

hospital-quarantined group. A behavior-changed group, strives to reduce the transmission rate by 

social distancing and other measures, is also considered in this work. For the behavioral changes 

of  the  susceptible  group,  we  modified  the  model  of  prevalence-based  behavioral  change 

proposed  by  Perra  et  al.  (global,  prevalence-based  spread  of  the  fear  of  the  disease)  to  fit  the 

situation  in  the  Republic  of  Korea  (7).  The  total  population  ( 𝑁 )  consists  of  susceptible  ( 𝑆 ),

Epub ahead of printbehavior-changed susceptible  (𝑆𝐹),  virus-exposed  (𝐸), infectious  (𝐼), hospital-quarantined  (𝑄),  and 

recovered (𝑅) individuals. Figure 2 shows the flow diagram of COVID-19 transmission according to 

our model.  

 Figure 2 Flow diagram of COVID19 transmission dynamics 

 

As the number of confirmed cases  increases, the susceptible population moves to the behavior-

changed susceptible group as people strive to improve personal hygiene, for example by wearing 

a  mask,  and  practice  social  distancing,  for  example  by  refraining  from  mass  gatherings  or 

meetings, in awareness or fear of the spread of  the virus. Both the normal susceptible group (𝑆) 

that  did  not  implement  any  changes  in  behavior  as  well  as  the  behavior-changed  susceptible 

group  (𝑆𝐹)  can  be  exposed  to  the  virus  via  contact  with  infected  patients,  but  we  assumed  that 

the probability of transmission is decreased in the behavior-changed susceptible group.  

Individuals who were exposed to the virus via contact with infectious patients move to the virus-

exposed  group  (𝐸)  and  develop  symptoms  (𝐼)  after  the  virus  incubation  period.  After  symptoms 

onset, infectious  individuals (𝐼) visit the hospital, become confirmed and  quarantined  (𝑄). Finally, 

they  move  to  the  recovered  group  (𝑅)  after  a  recovery  period.  In  this  study,  we  assumed  that 

individuals  are  hospital  quarantined  after  a  confirmation  and,  thus,  cannot  infect  others.  Our 

mathematical  model  of  COVID-19  transmission  can  be  described  with  the  following  differential

Results 

We set the incubation period of the virus to 4.1 days, referring to the KCDC regular briefing on 

February 16 (8), and the mean period from symptom onset to confirm and isolation to 4 days (9). 

Period  from  isolation  to  recovery  was  set  to  14  days,  which  was  the  mean  of  16  discharged 

patients  according  to  the  detailed  information  on  confirmed  cases  reported  until  February  19. 

Mortality was not included in the present model as it was difficult to calculate the exact value at 

this  point.  Table  1  shows  the  description  and  values  of  the  parameters  used  in  the  model.  To 

define the initial value of the model, we used the 31st case confirmed on February 18 as 𝑄(0). 

To estimate the transmission rate and the rate of individuals moving from the susceptible to the 

behavior-changed susceptible group, we used a least-squares fitting method that minimizes the 

sum of the squares of the differences between the cumulative cases data and the model curve. 

The estimated values for all parameters, for the Daegu/Gyeongbuk area and nationwide, are 

presented in Table 1. Table 1 Parameter description and values

Figure 3 Data fitting results 

 

We predicted the timing of the end of the COVID-19 outbreak and the total number of confirmed 

patients using the estimated parameters described above and obtained the following results. The 

end point of the COVID-19 outbreak is defined as a date that the number of expected daily new 

case is less than 1. The graph on the left in  

Figure 4 shows the number of cumulative confirmed cases over time, while the graph on the right 

shows  the  number  of  isolated  patients  over  time.  The  predicted  values  of  nationwide  cases  are 

represented by the black solid line and the Daegu/Gyeongbuk cases by the red dashed line.

Epub ahead of printFigure 4 Model prediction using estimated parameters 

According  to  the  model,  approximately  13,800  cases  are  expected  to  occur  nationwide,  and  the 

date of the  last  confirmed case  will be June 14.  In the Daegu/Gyeongbuk region, approximately 

11,400 cases are expected to occur until May 27. The proportion of Daegu/Gyeongbuk cases by 

the  end  of  the  outbreak  is  estimated  at  82.70%.  The  number  of  cumulative  cases  per  100,000 

people  is  predicted  to  be  26.68  nationwide  and  224.64  in  the  Daegu/Gyeongbuk  area.  The 

number  of  isolated  patients,  both  nationwide  and  in  Daegu/Gyeongbuk,  will  peak  on  March  11 

and then start to decrease. The maximum number of isolated individuals predicted by the model 

is 4,656 nationwide, of which 4,167 are predicted to be located in the Daegu/Gyeongbuk area.

of transmission (𝛽/𝑁) to be at least 8.9 times higher in the Daegu/Gyeongbuk area, with 1.3616e-

7 per infected patient nationwide and 1.2145e-6 around Daegu/Gyeongbuk. The transmission rate

of  the  behavioral  changes  implemented  in  the  Daegu/Gyeongbuk  area  is  also  estimated  to  be 

lower than that of the national average.  

In  the  early  stages  of  the  outbreak,  the  period  from  symptom  onset  to  isolation  was  at  least  5 

days,  but  recently,  most  patients  are  confirmed  and  isolated  within  1-2  days  of  symptom  onset 

due to the active screening of close contacts by the KCDC. However, as there are still reports of 

cases of transmission after more than 5 days from symptom onset, we set the mean period from 

onset to isolation to 4 days in our model. The rate of reduction in transmission  in the behavior-

changed group significantly affects the model results. Since the rate of reduction in transmission 

that results from the currently implemented social distancing policies has never been studied, we 

factored  in  the  number  of  people  working  at  home  and  the  delayed  start  of  classes  and 

concluded  that  the  transmission  rate  will  decrease  by  about  1/50  or  more.  In  our  model,  a 

decrease in the parameter 𝛿 results in a decrease in the total number of confirmed cases and the 

duration of the outbreak.  

In  the  present  study,  we  assumed  that  the  susceptible  group  that  implemented  behavioral 

changes maintains a low transmission rate. However, when schools open again after March 24, an 

increase in the number of contacts and  a desensitization of the behavior-changed group with  a 

decreasing number of patients may lead to another cluster outbreak stemming from unconfirmed 

positive cases. 

Since  this  model  assumes  that  patients  are  isolated  at  diagnosis  and  cannot  spread  the  virus 

further, the recovery period and mortality rate do not affect the total number of patients, but they 

only affect the calculation of the number of isolated patients and the required inpatient beds. The 

number of daily isolated patients increases with an increasing recovery period and decreases with 

an increasing mortality rate.  

181 

 

182 

Conclusion 

The  COVID-19  pandemic  is  characterized  by  large-scale  cluster  outbreaks  in  specific  areas.  A 

large-scale  outbreak  within  a  region  beyond  the  capacity  of  local  hospitals  can  lead  to  some 

confirmed  patients  having  to  self-quarantine,  during  which  they  might  infect  other  people.  It  is, 

thus, necessary to predict the number of isolated patients over time through modeling to identify 

the number of beds required in advance and establish a response strategy.

Author’s Contributions 

While  in  the  Republic  of  Korea,  a  large-scale  outbreak  occurred  in  the  Daegu/Gyeongbuk  area, 

the results of our mathematical model show that up to about 1,000 confirmed cases may occur in 

regions outside Daegu/Gyeongbuk as well. As part of the government’s active intervention policy, 

powerful  non-pharmaceutical  interventions  such  as  postponing  the  start  of  classes  in 

elementary/middle/high schools and reducing mass gatherings are being implemented. However, 

given  that  the  outbreak  is  expected  to  continue  through  June,  it  will  be  difficult  to  sustain  the 

strengthened  non-pharmaceutical  interventions.  Therefore,  even  after  schools  open  again,  it  will 

be  necessary  to  suggest  sustainable  nonpharmaceutical  intervention  guidelines,  for  example 

reinforcing  personal  hygiene  practices  such  as  mask  wearing  and  hand  washing,  encouraging 

people  to  avoid  close  contact  and  visit  a  medical  center  quickly  after  suspicious  symptoms 

develop, and shortening the time from symptom onset to isolation.
