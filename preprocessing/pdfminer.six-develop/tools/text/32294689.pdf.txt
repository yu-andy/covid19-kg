‘‘Is my son at risk in view of COVID-19?’’ A patient’s
mother contacted our Schizophrenia Outpatient Clinic as
soon as news about the coronavirus pandemic reached
Brazilian headlines. I immediately remembered how we
hear in mental health services that ‘‘patients with severe
mental
illness are immune deﬁcient.’’ But is this true?
What are the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic for
schizophrenia patients and their families?

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),
has affected over 750,000 people worldwide and has led
to 36,405 deaths,1 becoming a major concern for all health
systems. Although the global prevalence of schizophrenia
is D 0.4%,2 it represents a large burden to families and
society. These patients also have high mortality rates and
comorbid medical conditions. If they are more susceptible
to SARS-CoV2 infection, have worse clinical outcomes
once contaminated, or have psychotic relapses in the con-
text of the COVID-19 pandemic, there will be an additional
burden to a system that is already pressed to the limit.
To help families and policy makers make better informed
decisions and develop preventive measures, we intend to
address the following questions: Are schizophrenia patients
at higher risk of: 1) being contaminated; 2) mortality; and
3) suffering a psychotic relapse?

Regarding the ﬁrst question, we performed a literature
review through Medline, searching from inception to March
16, 2020. We included original, peer-reviewed articles in
English assessing any diagnosis of respiratory infection,
regardless of causal agent, among schizophrenia patients.
All 315 reports were screened blindly by two authors in two
phases (title and abstract; and full-text review), resulting in
18 articles selected for data retrieval.

Few reports speciﬁcally addressed viral infections. Over-
all, the articles suggested higher odds of pneumonia and
mortality. Although community-acquired pneumonia is non-
transmissible, it could indicate immunodeﬁciency.3,4 Thus,
our search indicated that this population could be at higher
risk of developing respiratory infections, especially when

comorbid medical conditions and lifestyle risk factors are
involved.

Older age and clinical comorbidities increase mortality
rates among COVID-19 patients.5 More than 70% of all
schizophrenia patients also have one or more clinical con-
ditions,6 including diabetes type II,7,8 pulmonary chronic
disease,9 and hypertension/coronary heart disease.10,11
Smoking estimates among schizophrenia patients vary
from 50 to 90%,12 compared to 20-30% in the general popu-
lation, and involve higher smoking intensity, another poten-
tial risk factor for respiratory complications,13 although it
is not yet clear whether COVID-19 outcomes are worse
among smokers.14 Spirometric assessment indicates that
schizophrenia patients have impaired lung function, and
they are more often diagnosed with restrictive and obstruc-
tive pulmonary diseases.15 In addition, when hospitalized
for pulmonary conditions, schizophrenia patients have higher
rates of intensive care unit admissions, acute respiratory
failure, mechanical ventilation, and in-hospital death than
other patients.16 They also have a higher risk of acute
organ dysfunction than the general population when
admitted to the intensive care unit, regardless of cause.16
Overall, most schizophrenia patients would ﬁt at least
one known risk group for COVID-19 and, if admitted to a
hospital, should be considered at increased risk of worse
clinical outcomes.

Although this review did not yield a deﬁnite answer to
our questions, the contextual data lead us to infer that
there is a greater infection risk in schizophrenia patients.
Quarantine has been proven necessary when a site
reaches a certain level of COVID-19 contamination, and it
has been decisive in positive outcomes, especially when
implemented early.17 Due to its transmission character-
istics, COVID-19 requires both respiratory and contact
isolation.18 Schizophrenia patients appear to have greater
difﬁculty following adequate hygiene practices than the
general population.19 Oral hygiene deﬁcits have been parti-
cularly well documented20 and could certainly increase vul-
nerability to respiratory diseases.21 Schizophrenia inpatients

Table 1 Recommendations for health professionals and families regarding schizophrenia patients

1. Schizophrenia patients should follow the same health instructions (e.g., inﬂuenza vaccine – unless speciﬁc restrictions apply) and receive

the same treatment as clinical high-risk groups for COVID-19.

2. General practitioners treating COVID-19 patients should pay special attention to those with schizophrenia, since they could minimize or

have difﬁculty describing respiratory symptoms.

3. Mental health professionals should remotely monitor unstable outpatients and, when possible, use telehealth (internet-based)

technologies to provide more frequent clinical contact and support for emerging concerns.

4. Mental health services should inform patients and families of all procedures to be followed during this period and should provide clear

remote contact channels to minimize overcrowding and exposure. However, families should monitor for signs of relapse and contact
mental health services as soon as possible.

5. Professionals and families should promote and monitor adherence to antipsychotic medication regimens, as well as ensure access to
prescriptions, perhaps organizing a delivery system. It should also be emphasized that patients should continue regular medication
regimens, including clozapine.

6. To reduce emotional distress – and possibly psychotic relapse – families and patients should be advised to:

- Anticipate stress reactions and be informed about them by professionals.
- Prepare for quarantine, which can be better adhered to if patients and families receive more information about the disease, about the
beneﬁts of quarantine (both personally and in terms of public health), and about quarantine procedures (such as adequate supplies of
food and medication).26

- Limit media exposure, since overexposure to broadcasts of stressful situations has been linked to negative mental health outcomes,27

and avoid misinformation.
In as much as possible, develop new routines that include leisure activities and physical exercise.

-

are at additional risk due enclosed treatment environ-
ments. Consequently, impaired judgement and poor self-
care, two features commonly observed in schizophrenia,
could hinder compliance with health recommendations
and put patients, their families, and health professionals
at risk.

However, beyond the direct risk of

Lower access to adequate medical care22 – one possi-
ble explanation for increased mortality in schizophrenia –
could also aggravate this scenario. Patients and their
families may have more difﬁculty identifying the initial symp-
toms of COVID-19 and seek health services. In addition,
even if they do request medical assistance, there is a
higher chance they will not receive proper assessment or
treatment due to the stigma surrounding schizophrenia.23
infection, could
COVID-19 indirectly lead to relapse among schizophrenia
patients? The main collective sanitary strategy for preven-
ting contamination is social isolation, which could generate
considerable distress, both for patients and caregivers.24,25
As a result, lack of access to regular psychosocial
inter-
ventions or medication (and subsequent reduced adher-
ence) could, of course, increase the chances of psychotic
symptoms, which is a major concern. Nonetheless, we beli-
eve that exposure to such a stressful life event, changes of
routine, and interpersonal anxiety due to prolonged quar-
antine or even the fear of contracting the disease could also
act as important triggers.

To the best of our knowledge, no study has provided
details on COVID-19 prevalence or outcomes in schizo-
phrenia patients. However, we believe that the available
evidence suggests they:

1) May have more difﬁculty following quarantine and ‘‘respi-
ratory etiquette’’ procedures and, thus, are at higher risk
of contamination;

2) Are at higher risk of poor COVID-19 outcomes, mainly
due to higher comorbidity rates and a possible immuno-
deﬁciency associated with schizophrenia;

3) Are at higher risk of relapse, considering the emotional
distress added to an already vulnerable group during
an infectious disease outbreak, their limited access to
community care, and the risk of interrupting medication.

Such risks vary from patient to patient according to
clinical comorbidities, cognitive impairment, acute symp-
toms, and family support, which can inﬂuence disease
severity and general health conditions.

Thus, we have produced a list of suggestions (Table 1)
that combine current recommendations for COVID-19 pre-
vention (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-
coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance) and the particulari
ties of schizophrenia.

In conclusion, schizophrenia patients are at higher
risk of infection and worse outcomes, especially if affec-
ted by clinical comorbidities. They are also vulnerable
to worsening psychiatric symptoms and relapse due to
fear of the disease, stress, and the boredom associated
with compulsory isolation. Therefore, health professionals
and families should provide extra attention and support
to prevent COVID-19 infection among individuals with
schizophrenia and should detect both respiratory and
psychiatric symptoms as early as possible.
