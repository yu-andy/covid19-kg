Abstract 

The  recent  outbreak  of  coronavirus  disease  2019  (COVID-19)  caused  by  SARS-CoV-2  in 

December  2019  raised  global  health  concerns.  The  viral  3-chymotrypsin-like  cysteine  protease 

(3CLpro)  enzyme  controls  coronavirus  replication  and  is  essential  for  its  life  cycle.  3CLpro  is  a 

proven  drug  discovery  target  in  the  case  of  severe  acute  respiratory  syndrome  coronavirus 

(SARS-CoV)  and  middle  east  respiratory  syndrome  coronavirus  (MERS-CoV).  Recent  studies 

revealed  that  the  genome  sequence  of  SARS-CoV-2  is  very  similar  to  that  of  SARS-CoV. 

Therefore,  herein,  we  analysed  the  3CLpro  sequence,  constructed  its  3D  homology  model,  and 

screened 

it  against  a  medicinal  plant 

library  containing  32,297  potential  anti-viral 

phytochemicals/traditional  Chinese  medicinal  compounds.  Our  analyses  revealed  that  the  top 

nine hits might serve as potential anti- SARS-CoV-2 lead molecules for further optimisation and 

drug development process to combat COVID-19.

The  first  case  of  the  novel  coronavirus  was  reported  on  December  30,  2019,  in  Wuhan  city, 

Hubei province, P.R. China [1]. Swift actions were taken by the Centre for Disease Control and 

Prevention (CDC), Chinese health authorities, and researchers. The  World Health Organization 

(WHO) temporarily named this pathogen 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) [2]. On January 

10,  2020,  the  first  whole-genome  sequence  of  2019-nCoV  was  released,  which  helped 

researchers to quickly identify the virus in patients using reverse-transcription polymerase chain 

reaction  (RT-PCR)  methods  [3].  On  January  21,  the  first  article  related  to  2019-nCoV  was 

published,  which  revealed  that  2019-nCoV  belongs  to  the  beta-coronavirus  group,  sharing 

ancestry  with  bat  coronavirus  HKU9-1,  similar  to  SARS-coronaviruses,  and  despite  sequence 

diversity its spike protein interacts strongly with the human ACE2 receptor [1]. On January 30, 

the  WHO  announced  a  Public  Health  Emergency  of  International  Concern  (PHEIC)  for  the 

2019-nCoV outbreak. Later, the human-to-human transmission was confirmed. As of January 31, 

51  whole-genome  sequences  of  2019-nCoV  from  different  laboratories  and  regions  have  been 

submitted  to  GISAID  database  [4].  On  the  February  12th,  the  WHO  permanently  named  the 

2019-nCoV  pathogen  as  SARS-CoV-2  and  the  causing  disease  as  coronavirus  disease  2019 

(COVID-2019). Chinese government swift actions helped them to control COVID-19 in China. 

However,  SARS-CoV-2  quickly  spread  to  over  150  countries.  On  March  11th,  WHO  formally 

recognized the COVID-19 as a pandemic. By March 19th, 2020, the global death toll reached to 

9,913, with 2,42,650 laboratory-confirmed cases. The case fatality rate among infected people is 

varying  in  different  countries.  However,  global  case  fatality  rate  is  presently  around  3.92% 

(calculated as deaths / [deaths + laboratory confirmed cases]).

Coronaviruses  are  single-stranded  positive-sense  RNA  viruses  that  possess  large  viral  RNA 

genomes  [5].  Recent  studies  showed  that  SARS-CoV-2  has  a  similar  genomic  organization  to 

other  beta-coronaviruses,  consisting  of  a  5’-untranslated  region  (UTR),  a  replicase  complex 

(orf1ab) encoding non-structural proteins (nsps), a spike protein (S) gene, envelope protein (E) 

gene,  a  membrane  protein  (M)  gene,  a  nucleocapsid  protein  (N)  gene,  3’-UTR,  and  several 

unidentified non-structural open reading frames [3]. Although SARS-CoV-2 is classified into the 

beta-coronaviruses  group,  it  is  diverse  from  MERS-CoV  and  SARS-CoV.  Recent  studies 

highlighted  that  SARS-CoV-2  genes  share  <80%  nucleotide  identity  and  89.10%  nucleotide 

similarity  with  SARS-CoV  genes  [6,  7].  Usually,  beta-coronaviruses  produce  a  ~800  kDa 

polypeptide  upon  transcription  of  the  genome.  This  polypeptide  is  proteolytically  cleaved  to 

generate various proteins. The proteolytic processing is mediated by papain-like protease (PLpro) 

and 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro). The 3CLpro cleaves the polyprotein at 11 distinct sites 

to generate various non-structural proteins that are important for viral replication [8]. 3CLpro play 

a critical role in the replication of virus particles and unlike structural/accessory protein-encoding 

genes, it is located at the 3’ end which exhibits excessive variability. Therefore, it is a potential 

target for anti-coronaviruses inhibitors screening [9]. Structure-based activity analyses and high-

throughput  studies  have  identified  potential  inhibitors  for  SARS-CoV  and  MERS-CoV  3CLpro 

[10-12].  Medicinal  plants,  especially  those  employed  in  traditional  Chinese  medicine,  have 

attracted  significant  attention  because  they  include  bioactive  compounds  that  could  be  used  to 

develop  formal  drugs  against  several  diseases  with  no  or  minimal  side-effects  [13].  Therefore, 

the present study was conducted to obtain structural insight into the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro and to 

discover potent anti-COVID-19 natural compounds.

Whole-genome sequences of all available SARS-CoV-2 isolates available till January 31, 2020, 

were downloaded from GISAID database (accession numbers and details are given in Table S1) 

[4].  The  genome  sequence  of  BetaCoV/Kanagawa/1/2020  (GSAID:  EPI_ISL_402126)  was 

incomplete, 

and 

the 

genome 

sequence 

of  BetaCoV/bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/2013 

(EPI_ISL_402131) was an old sequence (2013), therefore these sequences were not included in 

our  analyses.  Gene  sequences  of  3CLpro were  extracted  from  the  whole-genome  sequences  and 

translated  into  protein  sequences  using  the  translate  tool  of  the  ExPASy  server  [14].  The  first 

SARS-CoV-2  sequence  (Wuhan-Hu-1;  GSAID:  EPI_ISL_402125)  was  used  as  a  reference  in 

our analysis.  

2.2. Sequence analyses  

In  order  to  identify  similar  sequences  and  key/conserved  residues,  and  to  infer  phylogeny, 

multiple  sequence  alignment  of  SARS-CoV-2  3CLpro  followed  by  phylogenetic  tree  analyses 

were  performed  using  T-Coffee  [15]  and  the  alignment  figure  was  generated  using  ESPript3 

[16]. Physicochemical parameters of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro including isoelectric point, instability 

index, grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY), and amino acid and atomic composition were 

investigated using the ProtParam tool of ExPASy [14].  

2.3. Structural analyses  

To probe the molecular architecture of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, comparative homology modelling 

was  performed  using  Modeller  v9.11  [17].  To  select  closely-related  templates  for  modelling, 

 

4

PSI-BLAST  was  performed  against  all  known  structures  in  the  protein  databank  (PDB)  [18]. 

Chimera  v1.8.1  [19]  and  PyMOL  educational  version  [20]  were  used  for  initial  quality 

estimation, energy minimisation, mutation analyses, and image processing. 

2.4. Ligand database preparation and molecular docking    

A  comprehensive  medicinal  plant  library  containing  32,297  potential  anti-viral  phytochemicals 

and traditional Chinese medicinal compounds was generated from our previously collected data 

and  studies  [13,  21-23]  and  screened  against  the  predicted  SARS-CoV-2  3CLpro  structure. 

Molecular  operating  environment  (MOE)  [24]  was  used  for  molecular  docking,  ligand-protein 

interaction  and  drug  likeness  analyses.  All  analyses  were  performed  using  same  protocols  that 

are  already  described  in  our  previous  studies  [13,  25,  26].  The  qualitative  assessment  of 

absorption,  deposition,  metabolism,  excretion  and  toxicity  (ADMET)  profile  of  selected  hits 

were predicted computationally by using ADMETsar server [27]. 

2.5. Molecular dynamics simulations 

Explicit solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to verify docking results 

and  to  analyse  the  binding  behaviour  and  stability  of  potential  compounds  using  the  predicted 

101 

SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro homology model. GROMOS96 and the PRODRG server were employed to 

run 50 ns MD simulations [28, 29] following same protocol as described in our previous studies

Multiple  sequence  alignment  results  revealed  that  3CLpro  was  conserved,  with  100%  identity 

110 

among  all  SARS-CoV-2  genomes.  Next,  the  SARS-CoV-2  3CLpro  protein  sequence  was 

compared  with  its  closest  homologs  (Bat-CoV,  SARS-CoV,  MERS-CoV,  Human-CoV  and 

112 

Bovine-CoV).  The  results  revealed  that  SARS-CoV-2  3CLpro  clustered  with  bat  SARS-like 

coronaviruses and sharing 99.02%  sequence identity (Fig. 1A).  Furthermore, it shares  96.08%, 

87.00%, 90.00% and 90.00% sequence identity with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, Human-CoV and 

Bovine-CoV  homologs,  respectively  (Fig.  1B).  These  finding  were  consistent  with  an  initial 

study reporting that SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV, and shares a 

common  ancestor  with  bat  coronaviruses  [1,  3,  31].  Analysis  of  physicochemical  parameters 

118 

revealed  that  the  SARS-CoV-2  3CLpro  polypeptide  is  306  amino  acids  long  with  a  molecular 

weight  of  33,796.64  Da  and  a  GRAVY  score  of  -0.019,  categorising  the  protein  as  a  stable, 

hydrophilic molecule capable of establishing hydrogen bonds (Table 1).  

Next, for comparative modelling, BLAST [32] search identified SARS-CoV 3CLpro (PDB ID: 

3M3V) as the best possible match in the PDB, with 100% query coverage, an E-value of 0.00, 

and 96.08% sequence identity. There were 12-point mutations (Val35Thr, Ser46Ala, Asn65Ser, 

Val86Leu,  Lys88Arg,  Ala94Ser,  Phe134His,  Asn180Lys,  Val202Leu,  Ser267Ala,  Ser284Ala 

and  Leu286Ala)  between  SARS-CoV  and  SARS-CoV-2  3CLpro  enzymes  (Fig.  S1).  Except  for 

replacement  of  Leu  with  Ala  at  position  286,  all  other  replacements  conserve  polarity  and 

127 

hydrophobicity. However, these mutations may affect 3CLpro structure and function. Therefore, 

 

6

128 

the 3D structure of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro was predicted. Firstly, a single chain monomeric model 

129 

comprising all domains (Domain I = residues 8- 100; Domain II = residues 101- 183; Domain III 

130 

= residues 200- 303) was built (Fig. S2). N-terminal amino acids 1 to 7 form the N-finger that 

plays a significant role in dimerization and formation of the active site of 3CLpro. Domains I and 

II,  collectively  referred  to  as  the  N-terminal  domain,  includes  an  antiparallel  β-sheet  structure 

with 13 β-strands. The binding site for the substrate is situated in a cleft between domains I and 

II. A loop from residues 184 to 199 joins the N-terminal domain and Domain III, which is also 

called the C-terminal domain and comprises an anti-parallel cluster of five α-helices. The overall 

136 

molecular  architecture  of  SARS-CoV-2  3CLpro  was  in  consistent  with  the  crystal  structure  of 

SARS-CoV (PDB ID: 3M3V); the root mean square deviation (RMSD) between the homology 

model and the template was 0.629 Å. Structural and Ramachandran plot analyses revealed that 

99% of residues are in favourable regions. 

After  quality  assessment,  individual  chains  were  combined  to  form  a  homodimeric  3D 

structure, as shown in Fig. 1C. To facilitate other researchers, the predicted 3D model has been 

submitted  to  the  Protein  Model  Database  (PMDB)  [33],  and  anyone  can  download/use  the 

143 

SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro final structure using PMDB ID: PM0082635. Further, mutational analyses 

depicted  none  of  the  mutations  affected  the  overall  structure  of  SARS-CoV-2,  which  fully 

145 

superimposed  on  the  SARS-CoV  3CLpro  structure  (Fig.  1D).  The  results  also  revealed  that 

146 

SARS-CoV-2 has a Cys-His catalytic dyad (Cys-145 and His-41), consistent with SARS 3CLpro 

147 

(Cys-145 and His-41), TGEV 3CLpro (Cys-144 and His-41) and HCoV 3CLpro (Cys-144 and His-

41)  [34].  These  results  revealed  that  the  SARS-CoV-2  3CLpro  receptor-binding  pocket 

conformation resembles that of the SARS-CoV 3CLpro binding pocket and raises the possibility

that  inhibitors  intended  for  SARS-CoV  3CLpro  may  also  inhibit  the  activity  of  SARS-CoV-2

3CLpro.

To test this hypothesis, we docked (R)-N-(4-(tert-butyl)phenyl)-N-(2-(tert-butylamino)-2-oxo-1-

(pyridin-3-yl)ethyl)furan-2-carboxamide),  a  potential  noncovalent  inhibitor  of  SARS-CoV 

155 

3CLpro  named  ML188  [35],  with  the  SARS-CoV-2  3CLpro  homology  model.  We  also  docked 

ML188  with  the  SARS-CoV  3CLpro  structure  (PDB  ID:  3M3V)  as  a  reference,  and  ML188 

bound strongly to the receptor binding site of SARS-CoV 3CLpro. The inhibitor targets the Cys-

His catalytic dyad (Cys-145 and His-41) along with the other residues, and the docking score (S 

= -12.27) was relatively high. However, surprisingly, ML188 did not show significant binding to 

the catalytic dyad (Cys-145 and His-41) of SARS-CoV-2, and the docking score (S = -8.31) was 

considerably  lower  (Fig.  S3).  These  results  indicated  that  the  12-point  mutations  identified  at 

previous step may disrupt important hydrogen bonds and alter the receptor binding site, thereby 

affecting its ability to bind with the SARS-CoV inhibitor. 

Therefore, it was essential to discover novel compounds that may inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro 

and  serve  as  potential  anti-COVID-19  drug  compounds.  We  developed  a  library  from  our 

previously  published  studies  that  contains  numerous  natural  compounds  possessing  potential 

anti-viral  activities  and  screened  it  against  the  SARS-CoV-2  3CLpro  homology  model.  Recent 

168 

drug repurposing studies proposed few drugs that target SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro and suggested that 

they  could  be  used  to  treat  COVID-19.  Herein,  we  selected  the  best  of  these  (Nelfinavir, 

Prulifloxacin  and  Colistin)  from  three  different  drug  repurposing  studies  [36,  37]  and  docked 

them  as  controls  in  the  present  study  (Fig.  S4).  Our  analyses  identified  nine  novel  non-toxic,

druggable  natural  compounds  that  are  predicted  to  bind  with  the  receptor  binding  site  and 

catalytic  dyad  (Cys-145  and  His-41)  of  SARS-CoV-2  3CLpro  (Table  2;  Fig.  S5).  ADMET 

profiling  of  the  selected  hits  is  given  in  Table  S2.  Among  these  screened  phytochemicals, 

5,7,3’,4’-tetrahydroxy-2’-(3,3-dimethylallyl) 

isoflavone, 

is  an 

isoflavone  extracted  from 

Psorothamnus arborescens [38], that exhibited the highest binding affinity (-29.57 kcal/mol) and 

docking score (S = -16.35), and formed strong hydrogen bonds with the catalytic dyad residues 

(Cys-145  and  His-41)  as  well  as  significant  interactions  with  the  receptor-binding  residues 

Thr24,  Thr25,  Thr26,  Cys44,  Thr45,  Ser46,  Met49,  Asn142,  Gly143,  His164,  Glu166  and 

Gln189 (Fig. 1E). A literature review revealed that 5,7,3’,4’-tetrahydroxy-2’-(3,3-dimethylallyl) 

isoflavone has  been successfully used as an anti-leishmanial agent [38], and it is also found in 

traditional  Chinese  medicine  records  [39].  Our  screened  phytochemicals  displayed  higher 

docking  scores,  stronger  binding  energies,  and  more  closer  interactions  with  the  conserved 

catalytic dyad residues (Cys-145 and His-41) than Nelfinavir, Prulifloxacin and Colistin. These 

results suggested that natural products identified in our study may prove more useful candidates 

for COVID-19 drug therapy.

3.3. MD simulations 

To  further  investigate  the  molecular  docking  results,  the  top  three  phytochemical  complexes, 

namely  5,7,3’,4’-tetrahydroxy-2’-(3,3-dimethylallyl) 

isoflavone,  myricitrin,  and  methyl 

rosmarinate, were subjected to 50 ns MD simulation. The root mean square deviation (RMSD), 

root mean square fluctuation (RMSF), radius of gyration (RoG) and hydrogen bond parameters 

were calculated. RMSD is an indicator of the stability of ligand-protein complexes. None of the 

complex showed any obvious fluctuations, and all three were stable, with average RMSD values 

of 1.6± 0.02   Å, 1.5± 0.02  Å and 1.7± 0.02 Å for 5,7,3’,4’-tetrahydroxy-2’-(3,3-dimethylallyl)

isoflavone, myricitrin, and methyl rosmarinate, respectively (Fig. 2A). RMSF is an indicator of 

residual  flexibility.  Minimal  fluctuations  were  observed  for  myricitrin  and  methyl  rosmarinate, 

and  the  overall  complexes  remained  stable  throughout  the  simulations.  The  functionally 

important  catalytic  dyad  residues  (Cys-145  and  His-41)  displayed  stable  behaviour,  and 

199 

fluctuations were observed toward the C-terminal end of the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro molecule (Fig. 

2B). RoG is an indicator of protein compactness, stability, and folding, and the results suggested 

normal behaviour for all three complexes; all remained compact and stable throughout the 50 ns 

simulations  (Fig.  2C).  In  addition,  hydrogen  bonds,  which  are  the  main  stabilising  interactions 

203 

factors  in  proteins,  suggested  that  the  SARS-CoV-2  3CLpro  internal  hydrogen  bonds  remain 

stable throughout the simulation, with no obvious fluctuations (Fig. 2D). These results confirmed 

our findings, and further indicated that these compounds may serve as potential anti-COVID-19 

drug sources.

4. Conclusion

In conclusion, our study revealed that 3CLpro is conserved in SARS-CoV-2. It is highly similar to 

bat  SARS-like  coronavirus  3CLpro,  with  some  differences  from  other  beta-coronaviruses.  We 

predicted  the  3D  structure  of  the  SARS-CoV-2  3CLpro  enzyme,  and  the  findings  may  help 

researchers working on COVID-19 drug discovery. Despite significant overall similarity with the 

212 

SARS-CoV  3CLpro  structure,  the  SARS-CoV-2  3CLpro  substrate  binding  site  had  some  key 

differences,  which  highlighted  the  need  for  rapid  drug  discovery  to  address  the  alarming 

COVID-19  pandemic.  Medicinal  plant  compounds  are  already  used  to  successfully  treat 

numerous  viral  diseases.  Herein,  we  screened  a  medicinal  plant  database  containing  32,297 

potential anti-viral phytochemicals and selected the top nine hits that may inhibit SARS-CoV-2

3CLpro activity and hence virus replication. Further in-vitro and in-vivo analyses are required to 

transform these potential inhibitors into clinical drugs. We anticipate that the insights obtained in 

the present study may prove valuable for exploring and developing novel natural anti-COVID-19 

therapeutic agents in the future.
