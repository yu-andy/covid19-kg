Abstract

Background: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China has been declared a public health emergency of international concern. The
cardiac injury is a common condition among the hospitalized patients with COVID-19. However, whether N
terminal pro B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) predicted outcome of severe COVID-19 patients was unknown.
Methods: The study initially enrolled 102 patients with severe COVID-19 from a continuous sample. After screening
out the ineligible cases, 54 patients were analyzed in this study. The primary outcome was in-hospital death
defined as the case fatality rate. Research information and following-up data were obtained from their medical
records.

Results: The best cut-off value of NT-proBNP for predicting in-hospital death was 88.64 pg/mL with the sensitivity
for 100% and the specificity for 66.67%. Patients with high NT-proBNP values (> 88.64 pg/mL) had a significantly
increased risk of death during the days of following-up compared with those with low values (≤88.64 pg/mL). After
adjustment for potential risk factors, NT-proBNP was independently correlated with in-hospital death.
Conclusion: NT-proBNP might be an independent risk factor for in-hospital death in patients with severe COVID-19.

Background
The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China has been declared a public
health emergency of international concern on 30 January
2020 [1]. Despite lower case fatality rate, SARS-CoV-2
has killed more people than SARS and MERS and the
number keeps growing [2]. Epidemic studies have de-
scribed that patients with severe COVID-19 were more
likely to develop adverse clinical outcomes with more

complications including acute respiratory distress syn-
drome, acute cardiac injury, acute kidney injury and
shock [3, 4]. Investigating prognostic markers for severe
patients provides insights for early therapeutic strategies.
Cardiac injury is a common condition among the hos-
pitalized patients with COVID-19. It was recently re-
ported that 19.7% patients from a total of 416 cases with
COVID-19 had cardiac injury with more adverse clinical
outcomes compared to those without cardiac injury [5].
Guo et al. also reported that COVID-19 patients with el-
evated TnT levels had higher mortality [6]. A retrospect-
ive, single-center case series of
the 138 COVID-19
patients study reported that 7.2 and 16.7% patients had
complications of acute cardiac injury and arrhythmia, re-
spectively [7]. The fraction of acute cardiac injury and

arrhythmia was even higher in severe patients with the
percentage of 22.2 and 44.4%, respectively. The patients
with severe COVID-19 also showed higher creatine
kinase-MB (CK-MB) and hypersensitive troponin I (hs-
TnI) levels than others [7].

A recent study demonstrated that the heart failure
marker, N terminal pro B type natriuretic peptide (NT-
increased significantly during the course of
proBNP),
hospitalization in those who ultimately died [6]. How-
ever,
there is no research concerning whether NT-
proBNP predicted the outcome of severe COVID-19
patients.

Methods
Subjects
The study initially enrolled 102 patients with severe
COVID-19 from a continuous sample in Hubei General
Hospital during the management by national medical
team. The study is a retrospective, observational registry
with clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT04292964. The
study was also registered on Chinese medical research
registration information system. All procedures were
followed the instructions of
local ethic committee
(approval NO. 20200701). Criteria for severe conditions
included respiratory rate ≥ 30/min or rest oxyhemoglo-
bin saturation (SPO2) ≤93% or oxygenation index (arter-
ial oxygen tension/ inspired oxygen fraction, PaO2/
FiO2) ≤300 mmHg. All the data was collected using a
same protocol by well-trained researchers with a double-
blind method. Patients lacking NT-proBNP results (n =
45) were excluded. Patients who had stroke (n = 2) and
acute myocardial infarction (n = 1) were excluded. Other
exclusion criteria including patients with malignant
tumor (n = 0) and pregnancy (n = 0) were also taken ac-
count. Finally, 54 patients with COVID-19 were studied
in this research.

Baseline data and follow-up
Demographic data, clinical features and medical history
were available and collected according to the patient rec-
ord system. Data collection of laboratory results were
defined using the first-time examination at admission
(within 24 h after admission). All the laboratory data was
tested in a same laboratory with the same standard. To
observe the risk of
in-hospital death, patients were
followed up from admission to discharge (1 to 15 days).
The primary outcome was in-hospital death defined as
the case fatality rate. The follow-up data were collected
from reviewing medical records by trained researchers
using double-blind method.

comparisons between NT-proBNP high group and low
group were made by the independent-samples T-test
(normally distributed continuous
variables), Mann-
Whitney U test
(nonnormally distributed continuous
variables) and chi-square test (categorical variables). The
best NT-proBNP cut-off was that of the highest product
of sensitivity and specificity for in-hospital death predic-
in-hospital death
tion. Cumulative survival curves of
were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit
estimation method with the log-rank test. Spearman cor-
relation analysis was used to investigate the coefficients
of NT-proBNP with selected covariates. Cox propor-
tional hazards models were used to screening out the
potential risk factors and analyzing the independent
effect of NT-proBNP for in-hospital death. Statistical
analyses were performed by SPSS 22.0 (SPSS, Chicago,
IL, USA) and a two-sided P < 0.05 was considered statis-
tically significant.

Results
Baseline characteristics
Baseline characteristics of participants were divided
into two groups by low and high NT-proBNP levels
(NT-proBNP≤88.64 pg/mL and NT-proBNP> 88.64 pg/
mL, Table 1) according to the cut-off value deter-
mined in the ROC curve (Fig. 1). Patients in NT-
proBNP high group were significantly older with
more comorbidities of hypertension (HP) and coron-
ary heart disease (CHD), higher levels of diastolic
blood pressure (DBP), myohemoglobin (MYO), CK-
MB, hs-TnI, blood urea, creatinine, white blood cell
(WBC), C-Reactive Protein (CRP) and procalcitonin
(PCT) and lower level of lymphocyte (LYM) than the
participants in NT-proBNP low group. Other charac-
teristics like sex, temperature, pulse rate, respiratory
rate,
and the history of
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and
diabetes showed no significance between two groups
with the different levels of NT-proBNP (Table 1.).

Spearman correlation coefficients of NT-proBNP with
selected covariates
In present study, plasma NT-proBNP was positively
correlated with age, urea, cardiac injury markers of
MYO, CK-MB and hs-TnI and systematic inflammation
makers of WBC, CRP, Hs-CRP and PCT (Supplemental
Table. 1).

Results of cox proportional hazards analyses of in-
hospital death
Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used
to evaluate potential associations between NT-proBNP
and in-hospital death. Results of univariate analyses
showed that
the hazard ratio (HR) of NT-proBNP
associated to in-hospital death was 1.369 (95% CI 1.217–
1.541, P < 0.001) for an increase of 100 pg/mL. Mean-
while, age, male, history of hypertension (HP), myoglobin
(MYO), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), high-sensitivity
troponin-I (Hs-TnI), urea, creatinine, white blood cell
(WBC), lymphocytes (LYM), c-reactive protein (CRP) and
procalcitonin (PCT) were correlated with the risk of in-
hospital death (Table 2).

Discussion
The present study for the first time showed the relation-
ship between plasma NT-proBNP level and the risk of
in-hospital death in severe COVID-19 patients. Severe
COVID-19 patients with high NT-proBNP levels tended
to be older with increased cardiac injury markers and
higher levels of systematic inflammation markers. Pa-
tients with high NT-proBNP (> 88.64 pg/mL) level had
lower cumulative survival rate. After adjusting for poten-
tial cofounders in separate modes, NT-proBNP pre-
sented as an independent risk factor of in-hospital death
in patients with severe COVID-19.

Previous studies have found that NT-proBNP is a
powerful and independent predictor of mortality in
community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) [8–10]. In these
studies, the best cut-off values of NT-proBNP for predic-
tion 30-day mortality were 1434.5 pg/mL and 1795.5 pg/
mL, respectively [8, 10]. The elevated NT-proBNP in these
cases was believed owing to the cardiac complications re-
sulted from complex interactions among preexisting con-
ditions, relative ischemia, up-regulation of the sympathetic
systemic inflammation and direct pathogen-
system,
mediated damage to the cardiovascular system [11].

However, the cutoff value of NT-proBNP to predict
the adverse outcome of severe COVID-19 patients was
far lower than the threshold to diagnose heart failure
(450 pg/mL for < 50 years, 900 pg/mL for 50–75 years
and 1800 pg/mL for > 75 years) [12] in present study. It
was suggested that the prognostic effect of plasma NT-
proBNP in severe COVID-19 patients could not fully
ascribe to heart failure induced by the virus or hypoxia.
Further understanding of physiological and pathological
significance of plasma NT-proBNP elevation in severe
COVID-19 patients might help clinicians make corre-
to reduce the risks of adverse
sponding decisions
outcome.

NT-proBNP is secreted in response to increased myo-
cardial wall stress [13]. It is also controlled by acute
injury and proinflammatory molecules such as
renal
lipopolysaccharide, interleukin 1, C-reactive protein, and
cardiotrophin I, which are independent of ventricular
function [14, 15]. It was consisted with the study finding
that NT-proBNP level was positively correlated to the

makers of cardiac injury, renal injury and systematic in-
flammation. And these makers also constituted the risks
of
in-hospital death according to the univariate Cox
proportional-hazards regression analysis. However, NT-
proBNP was an independent risk factor after accounting
these factors in multivariate Cox. The prognostic effect
of NT-proBNP might be a specific index of reflecting
the overall state of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The mechanism of SARS-CoV-2-induced cardiac in-
jury was still unclear. From the result of autopsy by
Xu and colleagues, a few interstitial mononuclear
inflammatory infiltrates were observed in heart biopsy,
indicating an inflammation induced cardiac injury
[16]. Other factors including the SARS-CoV-2 infec-
tion and invasion cardiomyocytes via the binding site
of angiotensin-converting enzyme-related carboxypep-
tidase (ACE2) [17], the pulmonary infection induced
inadequate oxygen supply to the myocardium and the
influences of cytokine storm syndrome [18–20] might
also contribute to the cardiac injury [21]. All these
contributes to the elevation of NT-proBNP and risks
of poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19.

The virus itself may also elevate the NT-proBNP
level in COVID-19 patients. SARS-CoV-2 binds with
ACE2, resulting the uncontrolled releasing of angio-
tensin 2 (ANGII) and restricted synthesis of ANG1–7
[22]. The latter exerts anti-inflammation effect to pro-
tect tissue while ANGII plays in an opposite role and
facilitates the secretion of NT-proBNP [22–24]. It in-
dicated that NT-proBNP level might associated with
the severity of
leading an adverse
outcome, which needs further verification.

infection thus

By investigating the prognostic effect of NT-proBNP
level of severe COVID-19 patients at admission, it might
be helpful to early identifying patients with poor progno-
ses. However, this study was limited by sample size and
a single test of NT-proBNP at admission. Larger studies
with continuous monitoring of NT-proBNP are neces-
sary to further confirm the prognostic effect of NT-
proBNP in patients with severe COVID-19.

Conclusion
In conclusion, NT-proBNP might be an independent
risk factor for in-hospital death in patients with severe
COVID-19.
