Abstract

The new type of pneumonia caused by the SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syn-
drome coronavirus 2) has been declared as a global public health concern by WHO. As of
April 3, 2020, more than 1,000,000 human infections have been diagnosed around the
world, which exhibited apparent person-to-person transmission characteristics of this virus.
The capacity of vertical transmission in SARS-CoV-2 remains controversial recently. Angio-
tensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is now confirmed as the receptor of SARS-CoV-2 and
plays essential roles in human infection and transmission. In present study, we collected the
online available single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to evaluate the cell specific
expression of ACE2 in maternal-fetal interface as well as in multiple fetal organs. Our results
revealed that ACE2 was highly expressed in maternal-fetal interface cells including stromal
cells and perivascular cells of decidua, and cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast in pla-
centa. Meanwhile, ACE2 was also expressed in specific cell types of human fetal heart, liver
and lung, but not in kidney. And in a study containing series fetal and post-natal mouse lung,
we observed ACE2 was dynamically changed over the time, and ACE2 was extremely high
in neonatal mice at post-natal day 1~3. In summary, this study revealed that the SARS-
CoV-2 receptor was widely spread in specific cell types of maternal-fetal interface and fetal
organs. And thus, both the vertical transmission and the placenta dysfunction/abortion
caused by SARS-CoV-2 need to be further carefully investigated in clinical practice.

Introduction

The new type of pneumonia caused by the SARS-CoV-2 has sparked alarm around the world.
[1] The ongoing outbreak was first reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and as of
April 3, 2020 more than 1,000,000 human infections have been confirmed around the world.

PLOS ONEACE2 expression in maternal-fetal interface

[2] Person-to-person transmission has been described both in hospital and family settings. [3]
To date, there are no effective drugs or vaccination available against SARS-CoV-2.

Notably, SARS-CoV-2 shared 79% sequence identify to SARS-CoV (Severe acute respira-
tory syndrome coronavirus) and they may both share the ACE2 as host receptor according to
structural analyses.[4] SARS-CoV uses ACE2 as one of the main receptors for the entry into
the host cells which plays a crucial role in the disease infection.[5] The target towards the inter-
action between the virus and receptor may be able to treat the disease. ACE2 is newly described
as Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) component and modulates blood pressure.[6] The expres-
sion and distribution of ACE2 has been reported in heart, lungs and kidneys, which exhibits
tissue-specific activity patterns.[7–9] Previous studies have also shown the expression of ACE2
in the placenta.[10] Furthermore, the serine protease for virus Spike (S) protein priming,
TMPRSS2, was identified to be indispensable for cell entry of SARS-CoV-2. [11]

The placenta is a unique mixed organ, acting as heart, lungs, liver, kidneys for the fetus,
which is formed only during pregnancy and plays a major role in preventing maternal-fetal
transmission of pathogens.[12] It has been reported that members of the coronavirus family
such as SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) may pose greater risk
in pregnant women than non-pregnant individuals and are responsible for severe complica-
tions during pregnancy.[13, 14] Considering the new SARS-CoV-2 seems to share similar
pathogenic and cell receptor as SARS-CoV, the new coronavirus may have the vertical trans-
mission potential to the fetus in pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2. [15]

Given the current lack of clinical data of the potential and outcome of pregnancy infected
by the SARS-CoV2, we use the promising scRNA-seq data to evaluate the expression of ACE2
and TMPRSS2 in maternal-fetal interface and different fetal organs. Our study gives a better
perspective of vertical transmission potential and virus’s impact on placenta function and early
pregnancy on the cellular level.

Processing and visualization of scRNA-seq data

The downloaded unique molecular identifier (UMI) count matrix was converted to Seurat
object using the R package Seurat v.3.1.1.[20] Then we normalized the raw gene expression
matrix using NormalizeData function with default parameters and visualized the expression
level using the Violin plot function in Seurat. For the Human placenta, we used the standard
pipeline of Seurat https://satijalab.org/seurat/v3.1/pbmc3k_tutorial.html. Since the low quality
cells had been excluded by original authors, we didn’t conduct the quality control procedures.

Results
Cell specific expression of ACE2/TMPRSS2 in maternal-fetal interface

Placenta and decidua are the main maternal-fetal interface during pregnancy, and virus recep-
tors expression in placenta and decidual cells may play important role in promoting transmis-
sion of SARS-CoV-2. We obtained single cell transcriptome data sequenced by 10X Genomics
of early placenta (6~14 gestational weeks) containing ~65,000 cells.[16] And 32 cell types were
observed, of which four main cell types expressed ACE2 gene, including stromal cells (dS) and
perivascular cells (dP) in decidua, and villous cytotrophoblast (VCT) and syncytiotrophoblast
(SCT) in placenta (Fig 1A and 1B). The extravillous trophoblast (EVT) did not express ACE2
at this time. TMPRSS2 was expressed in VCT and epithelial glandular cells (Epi), and also had
low expression in SCT. Another independent single cell study of trophoblasts in human pla-
centa confirmed the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in VCT and SCT (Fig 1C).[17] In
addition, the EVT cells had extremely low level of ACE2 at early placenta (8 week) which was
consistent with previous study, while the ACE2 expression was significantly increased in EVT
at later stage of pregnancy (24 week). And TMPRSS2 also found a similar dynamic alteration
(Fig 1C). These results suggest that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were co-expressed in VCT, SCT and
EVT cells in maternal-fetal interface, and the expression level of ACE2/TMPRSS2 in maternal-
fetal interface may increase along with trimester of pregnancy.

Cell specific expression of ACE2/TMPRSS2 in human fetal organs

As the essential elements of virus transmission, the expression of virus receptors in target
organs is another determining factor for fetus vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2. We then screened
the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in multiple fetal organs including heart, lungs, liver and
kidneys based on the online published single cell transcriptome studies. In a fetal heart single
cell study covering early to late fetal stages [18], we observed that ACE2 was expressed in cardi-
omyocytes (CM), macrophages and smooth muscle cells and pericytes (SMC/Peri). TMPRSS2
was also observed in cardiomyocytes. In a human fetal liver cell atlas [19], ACE2 was detected
in erythroid, fibroblast and hepatocyte (Fig 2B). Although it seems that there was no change of
ACE2 over the gestational stage (Fig 2C), the expression proportion of ACE2 was gradually
increased in fibroblast and hepatocytes from early to mid-stage of pregnancy. (Fig 2D) And
hepatocytes possessed the highest proportion of ACE2 positive cells compared to fibroblast
and erythroid. (Fig 2D) The expression of TMPRSS2 was relatively lower, but could be found
in hepatocyte and kuppffer cells. (Fig 2B) In a single cell study of fetal kidney at 7–9 week, we
did not observe ACE2 expression in any cell type; and the abundance of TMPRSS2 was
extremely low, and there were only few positive cells in ILC precursor and megakaryocyte sub-
types. (Fig 2E) In a lung cell atlas of human at post-natal day 1, we observed that both ACE2
and TMPRSS2 were highly expressed in airway epithelial cell and arterial endothelial cells
(AT1 and AT2) (Fig 2F). As lung is the major target organ of SARS-CoV-2, the high co-
expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 strongly suggests a high risk of infection of newborns

through airborne transmission. These data showed the evidence of abundant expression of
ACE2 and moderate expression of TMPRSS2 in the main human fetal organs.

Dynamic expression of ACE2/TMPRSS2 in fetal and neonatal mouse lung

Since the respiratory system undergoes a series of structural and functional changes necessary
for adaptation to air breathing at birth, and lung is a major organ to be attacked by SARS-
CoV-2 virus, the dynamic changes of pulmonary cells gene expression are necessary to be
investigated before and after birth to predict the potential infection of fetal and neonatal indi-
viduals. Because cell atlas of human fetal lung is unavailable, we obtained mouse lung cell atlas
from late pregnancy (E16.5, E18.5) to PND 28. The cell type annotation obtained from previ-
ous report was shown in Fig 3A.[21] In late pregnancy stage, both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were
highly expressed in airway epithelial cells, which were consistent with human fetal lung. A sig-
nificant alteration of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was observed in murine lung. At earliest days (PND
1~3), we observed ACE2/TMPRSS2 was highly co-expressed in many cell types such as
Sox2hi, alveolar cells (AT1/AT2), ciliated cell and Club cells. Pulmonary cells at this stage
exhibited higher expression of ACE2 than that in fetal phase or later days, suggesting that new-
born might be a high-risk population vulnerable to be infected by SARS-CoV-2. After the
PND 1~3, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 recovered to relatively low level in lung and mainly expressed
in epithelial cells, which is similar to that in adult human lung [22] (Fig 3B and 3C). These
results suggest that the alternative expression of ACE2/TMPRSS2 in pulmonary cells before
and after birth may contribute to the virus infection through vertical or respiratory transmis-
sion, and ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were highly co-expressed across different cell types of murine
lung. And the molecular cell study of human lung at fetal and post-natal stage is further neces-
sary, to reveal the potency and mechanism of infant infection by SARS-CoV-2.

Discussion

As the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic continues, pregnant women may be at high risks of affection
due to under an immunosuppressive state, and the affection status of mothers may cause
adverse maternal and neonatal complications and outcomes.[15] Following this, the urgent
questions need to be addressed are that whether the SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted verti-
cally to the fetus through maternal-fetal interface and whether the affection of the virus would
cause the dysfunction of placenta or even abortion among pregnant women.

Based on the scRNA-seq data of early human placenta (first trimester), we have identified
the high expression of ACE2 in four main cell types including dS cells and dP cells in decidua,
VCT and SCT cells in placenta. However, the expression of ACE2 was at extremely low level in
EVT at first trimester. The second study of human placenta confirmed the result and showed
increasing expression of ACE2 in EVT at 24 week. The major function of the placenta is main-
tained by trophoblast cells including VCT, SCT and EVT.[23] The SCT is the outer lining of
the placental villi which has direct contact with maternal blood flowing into the intervillous
space which also plays as the main site of maternal and fetal exchange.[24] The high expression
of ACE2 in these cells suggests that placenta has the potential to be infected by SARS-CoV-2
and may cause placenta dysfunction and pregnancy complications. Yet there is no scRNA-seq
data human placenta in third trimester, we predict the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in
maternal-fetal interface may increase along with trimester of pregnancy. Importantly, it has

also been validated the abundant existence of protein expression of ACE2 in the dS cells in
decidua and SCT cells in placenta using immunohistochemistry (IHC), which was in accor-
dance with the mRNA expression pattern from our findings.[10, 25]

We then assessed the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the main organs including fetal

heart, lung, liver and kidney. The expression of ACE2 was detected in the main cell types of
heart like CM and SMC/Peri, and TMPRSS2 was also observed in CM. CM is the major func-
tional cells of heart, and may cause cardiac dysfunction if affected by virus.[26] SMC/Peri cells
are major perivascular cell types [27], and may be involved in the implantation of virus
through infiltration of blood vessels. The increasing expression of ACE2 in liver fibroblast and
hepatocytes was detected from first to second trimester. These results suggest that fetal liver is
an vulnerable target organ of SARS-COV-2 virus, and its risk is increasing as the pregnancy
progresses. Interestingly, we did not detect the ACE2 expression in kidney while TMPRSS2
was moderately expressed in this organ. This result is different from adult human kidney in
which ACE2 is highly expressed in proximal convoluted tubule cells and proximal tubule cells.
[28] We further analyzed the data of human lung at PND 1, both airway epithelial cell and arte-
rial endothelial cells showed high expression of ACE2. This result is different from adult lung
in which alveolar cells (AT1/AT2) were the major ACE2+ cell types. [22] As the fetus has no
breath in maternal uterus, the airway epithelial cell may not be responsible for the vertical
transmission of virus, but may play essential role in neonatal infection via respiratory trans-
mission. Alternatively, the arterial endothelial cell expression of ACE2 may contribute to the
potential intrauterine infection of fetal lung. The data of a study containing series fetal and
post-natal mouse lung was analyzed, and we observed ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were extremely
high in neonatal mice at PND 1~3. The high level of ACE2 in lung may make neonate vulnera-
ble target of SARS-CoV-2. Humans and mouse are highly conservative regarding gene expres-
sion pattern, and we speculate that ACE2 may have the similar dynamic alterations of gene
expression in human lungs from fetal to neonatal phase, which needs to be further investigated
to evaluate the risk of intrauterine infection, canal infection and transmission possibility
through postnatal respiratory systems.

Given the genomic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, many clinical studies
have done on pregnant women affected by SARS-CoV. To our knowledge, no published arti-
cles have reported the existence of maternal-fetal transmission of SARS-CoV in clinical cases.
[29] Considering the low spread ability of SARS-CoV with ~8,000 infected patients worldwide,
the population of infected pregnant women was minimal among them, and thus the potency
of vertical transmission was evaluated insufficiently in SARS. However, the SARS-CoV-2 has
become super-spreading event around the world and been announced as a pandemic by
WHO, which caused more than 1,000,000 cases worldwide as of April 3, 2020. Much more
cases of pregnant women infected by SARS-CoV-2 have been observed, compared to SARS-
CoV. Chen, et al has recently reported the result of pregnancy of nine pregnant women who
had pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV2.[30] Four infants were born prematurely but none
were born earlier than 36 weeks of gestation. All the infants and samples including amniotic
fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swabs showed negative result of the virus. However, given
the small sample size, the short time between illness onset and delivery and the biased included
pregnant women who were all at the late-stage of pregnancy and gave birth by cesarean sec-
tion, vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 still cannot be ruled out in this study. Most
recently, Dong et al. has reported a newborn with elevated IgM antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. As
IgM cannot be transferred across the placenta, and can only be produced by the fetus in
response to virus, this result suggests that the neonate was infected in utero. And the liver
injury of this neonate from the laboratory results also indirectly supports the possibility of ver-
tical transmission.[31] Another report collected the data of 6 pregnant women with

SARS-CoV-2. Notably, the virus-specific antibodies were detected in neonatal blood sera sam-
ples and the IgG concentrations which could be passively transferred across the placenta from
mother to fetus elevated in 5 infants. Importantly, 2 infants were also detected the existence of
IgM.[32, 33] These clinical studies strongly support the potency of vertical transmission of
SARS-CoV-2, which is highly consistent with our hypothesis based on the cell specific
enriched expression of the virus receptors in maternal-internal face and fetal organs.

Furthermore, women infected by SARS-CoV during pregnancy had a higher incidence of
adverse outcomes including spontaneous miscarriage, premature delivery, and intrauterine
growth restriction.[13] High maternal morbidity and mortality was associated with SARS-CoV
during pregnancy.[34]. The placental pathophysiology changes may be correlated with clinical
courses of the mother and fetus.[35] But the number of reported cases of pregnant women
with SARS-CoV is very limited. Nevertheless, pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 had mild
symptoms and better outcome compared with those with SARS-CoV.[30] The biophysical and
structural evidence showed that SARS-CoV-2 bind ACE2 with higher affinity than SARS-CoV,
which suggested that SARS-CoV-2 might have more possibility to attack placenta[36] The
published cases so far are quite limited and are restricted to women developing SARS-CoV-2
infection in third trimester (late pregnancy stage). It is still crucial to pay special attention to
pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 in early stage, during which the virus may affect
the function of placenta and increase the risk of miscarriage.

Study limitations

There are several limitations to this study. First, the gene expression levels were detected at
mRNA levels. Although several previous studies confirmed the protein expression of ACE2 in
placenta by IHC, systematic experimental validation of the protein distributions in maternal-
fetal interface and fetal organs is necessary in the future. The second, this study reported the
distribution of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, but the existence of vertical transmission and placenta
dysfunction caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection is just speculative, which needs to be further
evaluated by clinical investigations. The third, we revealed the dramatic alterations of ACE2/
TMPRSS2 expression from fetal to neonatal phases in mouse lung, which may contribute to
the respiratory transmission in neonates. But the alterative gene expression pattern in human
lung is not available to date, which needs to be further illuminated in the future.

Conclusion

This study demonstrates the expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptors in human maternal-fetal
interface and the main fetal organs. Both the vertical transmission and the placenta dysfunc-
tion/abortion caused by SARS-CoV-2 need to be further carefully investigated in clinical
practice.
