Nonpharmaceutical interventions for tackling the COVID-19 epidemic 
in Brazil
doi: 10.5123/S1679-49742020000200009 

COVID-19 was detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. In view of the growing number of cases, deaths 

and affected countries, on January 30th 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the event to be 
a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.¹ In Brazil, the epidemic was declared a Public Health 
Emergency of National Concern on February 3rd 2020.2, 3 Following notification of over 110,000 cases and 4,000 
deaths in countries on all continents, on March 11th 2020 WHO declared that COVID-19 had become pandemic.
In the absence of prior immunity in the human population and with no vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the causative 
agent of COVID-19, its highly virulent nature means that case numbers grow exponentially. Nonpharmaceutical 
interventions (NPIs) are indicated in this context, aimed at inhibiting transmission between humans, slowing the 
spread of the disease and consequently reducing and delaying the peak of its occurrence on the epidemiological 
curve.4 In this way, it is possible to reduce instantaneous demand for health care and mitigate the consequences 
of the disease for people’s health, including minimizing associated morbidity and mortality (Figure 1).5

NPIs are public health measures with personal, environmental and community scope. Individual measures 
include hand hygiene, respiratory etiquette and social distancing. In turn, social distancing involves case 
isolation, quarantine of contacts and the voluntary practice of not frequenting places where many people are 
gathered together.5

Another personal measure is the use of masks, recommended for people with confirmed or suspected coronavirus 
and their carers. WHO recommends that asymptomatic people should not use masks, due to lack of evidence as to 

1

there are no studies on the effectiveness of mask use by asymptomatic people for preventing COVID-19 transmission.
Environmental measures refer to rooms being well ventilated and exposed to the sun, as well as routine cleaning 
of indoor environments and other surfaces, these being procedures that help to eliminate the virus.5 SARS-CoV-2, 
like the influenza virus, can remain stable outside the human body, in aerosols and on various surfaces for up to 
three days, as in the case of plastic and stainless steel.7 Special attention must be paid to cleaning elevator buttons, 
handrails, public transport hand straps, door handles, card terminal buttons, smartphones, workstations, among 
other objects and surfaces which, if contaminated, can contribute to spreading viruses.

Community measures are actions taken by managers, employers and/or community leaders to protect the 
population. They include restricting access to schools, universities, community gathering places, public transport, 
as well as other places where large numbers of people gather, such as social and sports events, theaters, cinemas 
and commercial establishments, which are not characterized as providing essential services.5

The starting time and duration of the various community NPIs will influence their impact. It is a considerable 
challenge to determine the best time to start such interventions, as if they are implemented too soon this can result 
in economic and social hardships without any benefit for public health and, over time, can result in “intervention 
fatigue” and the population ceasing to commit to the intervention. On the other hand, implementation once 
the disease has become widespread can limit the benefits for public health. It needs to start soon enough to 
prevent the initial sharp rise in the number of cases, and last for long enough to cover the peak of the expected 
epidemic curve.5

In view of the knowledge gaps inherent to a new disease and considering the similarity between the behavior 
patterns of SARS-CoV-2 and the viruses that cause pandemic influenza, the strategies adopted in pandemic influenza 
contingency plans are being considered for the COVID-19 pandemic. The guidelines of the United States Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on pandemic influenza mitigation, indicate that the time to start 
interventions should be based on assessments of disease severity.8 Assessment of COVID-19, in accordance with the 
CDC Pandemic Severity Assessment Framework (PSAF), has indicated that the disease has high transmissibility 
and clinical severity.9 In view of the severity of the disease and the intensity of community transmission, the use 
of community NPIs to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic is justified.10

Measures such as home quarantine for infected people, social distancing and reduction in public gatherings, 
such as church services, as well as closing schools, were implemented during the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic 
in several cities in the United States.11  During the 2009 influenza pandemic, home quarantine was found to be 
feasible and achieved good uptake in Australia.12 The experience of China suggests that NPIs, which included strict 
lockdown measures, such as those adopted in the city of Wuhan with effect from January 23rd 2020, contributed 
to suppressing the COVID-19 epidemic in that country.4, 13 

On February 6th 2020, Brazil enacted Law No. 13979 which makes provisions for measures to address the COVID-19 
epidemic and lists the community NPIs that can be adopted. The country’s Federative Units began to adopt these 
measures with effect from the second week of March 2020. Examples include the state of Rio de Janeiro (Decree 
No. 46970, dated March 13th 2020),14 the Federal District (Decree No. 40520, dated March 14th 2020),15 the city of 
São Paulo (Decree No. 59.283, dated March 16th 2020)16 and the state of Santa Catarina (Decree No. 515, dated 
March 17th 2020)17 which, subsequently, approved new decrees establishing stricter measures. It is expected and 
desirable that actions to fight the epidemic will be reviewed and altered as it unfolds. It is noteworthy that the 
state of São Paulo, the country’s most populous state, adopted rigorous quarantine measures with effect from 
March 24th 2020.18

It should be highlighted that for some NPIs to be implemented, conditions of vulnerability peculiar to 
population subgroups need to be taken into consideration, such as street dwellers, people deprived of liberty, the 
institutionalized elderly,18 people living in overcrowded households, households without adequate ventilation or 
without running water, migrants, people with special needs, people who live alone, among others. 

Moreover, adopting these measures has important impacts on everyday activities, on people’s lives and on 
society. For example, children stop going to school, their studies are interrupted and they lose their access to school

in the case of children and the elderly.4, 19 Workers may be stopped from going to work, may need to alter their 
routines so as to work from home, or may lose their jobs or sources of income. Women and children in particular 
become more vulnerable to domestic and intrafamily violence. People, families, companies and countries are 
also expected to face economic losses.

Within this context, it is fundamental for the Brazilian National Health System (SUS) and the other areas of 
the social protection system to work together in an articulated manner, so as to favor people’s uptake of NPIs and 
minimize the detrimental impacts of community measures. Protecting public health must guide decisions to be 
taken by government managers. It is fundamental for these decisions to be based on the best available evidence 
and for them to be communicated in a transparent manner in order to gain the population’s trust. Guidance 
given by authorities and people’s uptake of NPIs will be determining factors for the course of the COVID-19 
epidemic in Brazil.
