Keyword: COVID-19

We are living in extraordinary times. COVID-19 is hav-
ing a profound effect on every aspect of our lives. Most
who read this will do so from their own homes. It will
have been weeks since many of us were at our normal
place of work, and it is likely to be many weeks, probably
months, before we are back there. Videoconferencing is
becoming second nature for us all.

Research into COVID-19 is exploding, as it needs to,
and this includes randomised trials. Between 23 January
2020 and 8 March 2020, there were 382 new registered
COVID-19 trials on the World Health Organisation
International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP)
[1]. The ICTRP COVID-19 trial list had grown to 586 by
31 March 2020 [2]. Most are based in China, but the
COVID-19 pandemic is now global, and trials are mov-
ing with it. Governments and the public are clamouring
for safe and effective treatments. Without rigorous, pro-
randomised trials, we risk exposing many
spective,
people to treatments that might not work. Now more
than ever, we need trialists to predefine and publicly
post their designs and analyses.

For transparency, for clear reporting, and to avoid du-
plication of effort, researchers need to know details
about these trials, and they need to know quickly. Trials
is proud of its record of publishing trial protocols, but
the process can be time-consuming in normal times,
and these are far from normal times.

Trials wants

for
COVID-19 trials that have ethical approval much faster

to make publishing protocols

and much simpler. Starting immediately, Trials is imple-
menting a simplified process for handling COVID-19
trial protocols. We understand that funding may be lim-
ited or difficult to secure at this time. BMC, the pub-
lisher of Trials, has a robust commitment to ensuring
that all work is published without barriers for authors
who may lack funding, especially important during the
COVID-19 outbreak.
If you anticipate difficulty in
speedily covering the cost of article-processing charges,
please state this in your initial inquiry and request a fee
waiver. The process is outlined in Table 1.

This process ensures rapid publication of a one-page
structured summary (based on Consolidated Standards
of Reporting Trials for abstracts [4]), which will be
indexed by PubMed. The full protocol will be attached
as an additional file and assigned a separate DOI (digital
object identifier) via Figshare [5]. In the interest of ex-
pediting dissemination of this material, the familiar Tri-
als formatting and structure will not be necessary for
this additional file. This will make full protocols quickly
available to other trialists and to trial funders. Registry
entries could also link back to the structured summary.

The

current pandemic

everything. For
COVID-19 trial protocols, transparency and speed must
take precedence. Our editorial processes have been
streamlined, and authors will receive direct support from
us to ready their structured summary for publication.

We do, however, urge trialists to ensure that their
studies are well designed and well reported. Good design
and reporting are needed no less in times of pandemics.
We also encourage authors to submit their full protocol
in the normal way for review to ensure reporting

What authors do

What we do

Visit https://trialsjournal.biomedcentral.com/covid-19 [3].
Download the structured summary and follow the links to contact us stating
your interest in submitting a COVID-19 structured summary and protocol.
The trial must already have ethical approval.
Please also state if you anticipate difficulty in covering the article-processing
charge.

Submit structured summary to Editorial Manager (https://www.
editorialmanager.com/trls/) using the Letter article type, with the full protocol
uploaded as an additional file (English language preferred, but we will accept
any language), following advice from Trials.

We send instructions and feedback for rapid submission. Every effort
will be made to respond within 24 h.

Review and approval from the Protocol Editor. Typesetting by
production, and publication without copyediting or proofing.

according to the Standard Protocol Items: Recommenda-
tions for Interventional Trials guideline [6].

All of us will look back on the COVID-19 pandemic
and ask ourselves what we did to help. As a journal dedi-
cated to randomised trials, what Trials can do is publish
information about COVID-19 trials rapidly, without bar-
riers and without adding to researchers’ workload. This
will be the journal’s contribution.
