On Feb. 21, 2020, a research group from the University of Bern published a paper titled “Rapid 
reconstruction of SARS-CoV-2 using a synthetic genomics platform”  [1] on the pre-print platform 
BioRxiv,  which  has  not  been  evaluated  by  peer  review.  Based  on  the  outbreak  of  (Coronavirus 
Disease 2019, COVID-19) sweeping the world, the authors claimed to have been able to engineer 
and resurrect chemically-synthesized clones of the (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 
2, SARS-CoV-2) with a yeast-based synthetic genomics platform. This paper presents the genetic 
reconstruction of diverse RNA viruses, including the novel coronavirus. The authors believe that 
with the use of this platform, generation of SARS-CoV-2 from chemically synthesized DNA could 
bypass  the  limited  availability  of  virus  isolates  to  allow  genetic  modifications  and  functional 
characterization of individual genes, as well as to generate serological diagnostics, to develop and 
assess  antivirals  and  vaccines,  and  to  establish  appropriate  in  vivo  models.  During  this  critical 
period  of  global  research  and  emerging  combat  with  this  epidemic  disease,  the  present  research 
could contribute to the development of antiviral therapeutics and that of a vaccine. 
 
The  authors  of  the  aforementioned  paper  claim  to  have  taken  into  consideration  the  “dual-use” 
problem.  The  so-called  “dual-use”  problem  in  biology  denotes  that  “the  techniques  needed  to 
engineer a bioweapon are the same as those needed to pursue legitimate research” [2]. For example, 
the pathogen synthesis technique can be used to rescue patients, as well as to possibly manufacture

bioweapons. Even if the motivation for the development of this type of technology is noble, any 
deviation,  misuse,  or  abuse  during  the  research  may  result  in  calamitous  consequences;  for 
instance, an accidental leak from the laboratory, or the purposeful misuse by others. 
 
The chemically synthesized SARS-CoV-2 virus is a part this type of technology, with the benefits 
mainly including the acceleration of therapeutics and vaccine development, and the protection of 
human life and health from the virus. However, the risks include the following: (1) Owing to the 
fact  that  SARS-CoV-2  is  a  virus  with  high  transmissibility  and  susceptibility,  there  exists  a 
biosecurity risk wherein bioterrorists could exploit this  characteristic, with potentially hazardous 
consequences. (2) By publishing the technology roadmap, it is possible for scientists and terrorists 
to be able to apply the same technique to synthesize more complex viruses  [3]27, or to develop a 
“super  virus”  with  extremely  high  infectivity,  virulence,  or  vaccine-resistant.  Currently,  internet 
has  made  it  easier  to  order  the  related  biological  materials  that  could  potentially  be  used  to 
synthesize bioweapons. (3) Accidental leakage of synthesized virus particles from the laboratory 
increases  biosafety  risks,  threatening  the  safety  of  humans  as  well  as  that  of  the  ecological 
environment. 
 
In view of these risks, the international scientific community had previously reached an agreement 
on the development of dual-use techniques. First, based on the “Convention on the Prohibition of 
the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons 
and  on  their  Destruction”  (better  known  as  “The  Biological  Weapons  Convention”  (BWC) 
effective since March 1975) and the existing international laws and regulations１, the research and 
development  of  dual-use  biotechnology  must  guarantee  safety  and  security,  and  never,  in  any 
circumstance, be used to harm the safety of individuals and the society at large. The convention 
and  the  relevant  laws  and  regulations  draw  a  red  line  for  dual-use  biotechnology  research,  to 
ensure  “morality  of  duty”２[4],  and  also  to  serve  as  the  bottom  line  for  the  development  of 
biological  science.  Second,  dual-use  biotechnology  must  promote  scientific  independent 
innovation while ensuring the protection of social safety. The two basic values of safety/security 
and intellectual freedom of research must be considered evenly. Therefore, countries all over the 
world  are  promoting  biotechnological  innovation  while  stressing  equally  on  the  importance  of 
biosafety  and  biosecurity  legislation.  To  reduce  the  predictable  risks  caused  by  the  dual-use  of 
biotechnology as much as possible, it is necessary to take the following into consideration before 
development of any high-risk technology: (1) Whether it is essential to undertake the research and 
to  undertake  it  now?  Whether  there  exist  other  alternative  technologies,  as  in,  whether  it  is 
necessary  and  urgent?  (2)  Whether  and  how  to  undertake  the  implemention  of  mandatory 
safety/security  measures?  (3)  Whether  and  how  to  compulsorily  certify  the  technology?  (4) 
Whether  and  how  to  educate  and  train  researchers?  (5)  Whether  and  how  to  investigate  the 
reliability of the researchers? (6) Whether and how to oversee the publication and propagation of 
the  research  results?  How  to  answer  the  above  questions  on  the  basis  of  balancing  the  value  of 

                                              
１  For  example,  “Regulation  of  Research  into  Biological  Disease  Agents  Act”  of  Israel,  “Public  Health  Security 
and bioterrorism preparedness response act” of the U.S., “Safety management measures for biotechnology research 
and development” of China, etc. 
２  The  so-called  “morality  of  duty”  lays  down  the  basic  rules  without  which  an  ordered  society  is  impossible  or 
without which an orderly society fails to achieve certain essential goals. Such moral norms can be regarded as a 
synonym of state law. The violation of such rules will lead to the punishment of the state's coercive power. 

safety/security and intellectual freedom, and risk assessment, depends on which subjects own the 
biosafety/biosecurity  regulation  rights,  and depends  on which  standard  technique  and  behavioral 
norm to carry out. 
 
According 
the  rights  distribution  on 
biosafety/biosecurity  regulation,  there  are  five  theoretical  and  practical  decision-making  models, 
ranging from an individual researcher to a complete government agency [3]63-64: 

to  previous  research,  from 

the  perspective  of 

 

 
There would exist some problems when the allocation of regulation rights is located too far on the 
left or right side of the above axis.  Individual scientists and research institutions (located on the 
left) may emphasize too much on the value of technological development during the determination 
of  the  value  tradeoff,  and  they  may  also  lack  the  professional  ability  to  assess  the  economic, 
political, and ethical issues arising from the development of a specific biotechnological innovation. 
On  the  right  side  of  the  axis,  government  agencies  often  lack  professional  judgment  on  rapidly 
changing  biotechnology;  they  may  overemphasize  the  value  of  social  safety/security  and  their 
strict  adherence  to  formal  norms  is  not  beneficial  for  flexible  case-by-case  decision-making. 
However,  in  the  case  of  the  independent  regulatory  agencies,  consisting  of  scientists,  ethicists, 
jurists, and government regulators, due to the diversity of their decision-making members, they are 
able  to  undertake  a  comprehensive  review  of  the  process  of  knowledge  acquisition  from  the 
perspectives  of  science,  economy,  politics,  and  law,  and  balance  the  value  between  social 
safety/security and technological development. 
 
With  respect  to  the  norms  of  biosafety/biosecurity  regulation,  owing  to  the  rapid  progress  of 
biological  research,  it  is  difficult  for  regulators  and  researchers  to  design  or  construct  clear  and 
specific  systems  for  the  measurement  or  ranking  of  the  variable  values  of  science,  economics, 
politics, and ethics involved in research. Therefore, even if a particular research action complies 
with the law, it does not mean that it is ethically responsible. To achieve responsible research３, it is 
necessary to supplement the deficiencies of the “hard law” with the more flexible, voluntary, and 
ethical “soft law,” so as to promote the voluntary participation of diverse groups and the action of 
the  safety  committee  within  the  research  institution,  and  to  encourage  the  relevant  personnel  to 
comply with the “morality of aspiration” or the “challenge of excellence”４[4]. 
 
As observed in the ethical statement from the research group of the University of Bern, there was 

                                              
３  Responsible research includes, but is not limited to, research with irreplaceable necessity, research behaviors 
with sufficient goodness, and research value with an optimal balance between risks and benefits. 
４  The so-called morality of aspiration is the morality of the Good Life, of excellence of the fullest realization of 
human powers. The violation of such a moral norm does not lead to the punishment of the state, but to the public’s 
evaluation of his or her quality. In such a case, man or woman would be condemned for shortcoming, instead of 
wrong doing. 

an  assessment  of  the  benefits  and  risks  involved  in  the  synthesis  of  SARS-CoV-2  virus  [1]15-16. 
Regarding  dual-use  biological  research,  Switzerland  utilizes  the  regulation  mode  where  an 
independent  biosafety  committee  and  government  agencies  share  the  determination  right:  the 
Swiss  Federal  Office  of  Public  Health  (FOPH)５and  the  relevant  ethics  committee  (the  Swiss 
Expert  Committee  for  Biosafety,６in  this  case),  and  other  regulators  (the  Federal  Office  for 
Environment  and  the  Federal  Food  Safety  and  Veterinary  Office,  in  this  case)  communicate  and 
negotiate,  and  finally  the  FOPH  gives  permission  according  to  the  review  of  the  aforesaid 
institutions.  However,  it  is  unclear  whether  the  balance  between  social  safety/security  and 
biotechnological innovation has been sufficiently evaluated and whether the representative public 
participation  has  been  absorbed  before  acquiring  administrative  permission,  due  to  the  brief 
ethical statement. 
 
In  fact,  there  has  always  existed  controversy  pertaining  to  the  gain-of-function  research  on 
engineering  viruses  in  the  scientific  community.  In  2011,  Ron  Fouchier  of  Erasmus  Medical 
Center, the Netherlands, and Yoshihiro Kawaoka at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, USA, 
separately  performed  the  genetic  alteration  of  the  H5N1  virus,  which  was  found  to  be  easily 
transmissible  between  ferrets  through  the  air.  Fouchier  claimed  that  it  was  “probably  one  of  the 
most dangerous viruses you can make”  [5]. Regarding this, scientists and critics believed that this 
highly transmissible virus could cause a huge risk to human beings if it was accidentally leaked or 
was misused by bioterrorists  [5]. In 2014, the U.S. Government instituted a pause on funding for 
any  new  studies  that  included  certain  gain-of-function  experiments  involving  influenza,  severe 
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) viruses, and 
encouraged those currently conducting this type of work to voluntarily pause their research while 
the  risks  and  benefits  were  being  reassessed  by  the  National  Science  Advisory  Board  for 
Biosecurity (NSABB) and the National Research Council (NRC) [6]. 
 
From  the  perspective  of  responsible  development  of  biotechnology,  regarding  to  the  risk 
assessment  of  a  highly  dangerous  virus  like  SARS-CoV-2,  it  is  necessary  to  clarify  the  items  of 
risk  assessment.  For  instance,  whether  the  yeast-based  synthetic  genome  method  in  the  paper  is 
irreplaceable in the development of therapeutics or a vaccine? If there are alternative safe methods 
to  develop  a  vaccine  and  select  therapeutics  with  recombinant  DNA  technology,  such  as 
recombinant viral protein, production of a pseudovirus, or transfection with mRNA fragments of 
viral  structure  proteins,  why  should  such  a  huge  risk  be  undertaken?  Especially,  the  risk  of  this 
virus  reconstruction  technique  (transformation-associated  recombination,  TAR)  is  in  the 
production of not only the novel coronavirus, but also other dangerous RNA viruses, such as other 
coronaviruses  and  the  Zika  virus  (ZIKV).  Faced  with  the  situation  where  other  laboratories  or 
universities (such as the University of North Carolina) are also trying to create a copy of the virus 
from scratch  [7], how can we ensure that this technology is not  misused or abused in the future? 
For  such  technologies,  which  can  be  easily  applied  or  converted  to  risk,  the  risk  of  publication 
needs to be strictly assessed, for example, whether to publish, to which group of people, and under 
what  circumstances  could  the  research  be  published?  In  addition,  how  should  we  compare  and 
quantify  which  groups  will  benefit  and  which  groups  will  undertake  the  risk,  and  what  is  the

criterion  of  determination?  Whether  scientists  have  enough  expertise  and  intelligence  to  fully 
assess  the  dual-use  risks  of  a  synthesized  virus  (including  the  assessment  of  the  motivation, 
condition,  and  capability  of  bioterrorists  to  acquire  SARS-CoV-2  or  to  design  and  synthesize  it) 
[3]54?  Once  the  risks  become  a  reality,  who  or  which  organization  should  take  responsibility  for 
them?  Whether  it  is  sufficient  to  deal  with  and  resolve  the  risk  only  depending  on  the 
“responsibility after the event”? Furthermore, the ratio of benefits to risks is not only a scientific 
issue, but also involves differences in risk perception and value judgment of different subjects; the 
views  about  the  risks  involved  often  differ  between  the  experts  and  the  public.  Then,  which 
subject’s  risk  sense  should  be  taken  into  consideration  in  the  prior  ethical  review  and  for  the 
determination  of  the  value  balance  between  social  safety/security  and  biotechnological 
innovation? 
 
According to the “AREA” theoretical framework [8], which was proposed by the Engineering and 
Physical Sciences Research Council of the UK (EPSRC) on the basis of Responsible (research and) 
Innovation  (RI/RRI),  its  contents  include:  Anticipation,  Reflection,  Engagement,  and  Action 
(AREA). We believe that research transparency and public participation are very important in the 
research  of  pathogen  synthesis  technology.  Scientists  and  regulators  should  cooperate  with  the 
public and other stakeholders to encourage dialogue with the public to address key issues, such as 
public  acceptability.  Although  scientific  research  requires  a  spirit  of  freedom  and  autonomy,  for 
such  dual-use  biotechnology  with  a  high-risk  potential,  no  single  scientist  and  scientific 
community can undertake the responsibility, once the risks materialize into real dangers. For that 
reason,  in  addition  to  enhancing  the  “self-government”  and  self-discipline  of  scientists  and 
scientific communities, government supervision  must be reinforced, laws and regulations should 
be  improved,  and  global  regulation  framework  ought  to be  constructed. Therefore, we  appeal  to 
scientists  to  be  highly  prudent  and  responsible  while  undertaking  the  research  and  development 
involving pathogen synthesis technologies. We share the same earth, interests, risks, and destiny 
and  therefore,  we  are  supposed  to  assume  equal  responsibility  to  protect  our  world.  The  whole 
world  should  join  hands  and  overcome  the  challenge  posed  by  this  novel  virus  together.  Only 
through  joint  participation  and  effective  regulation  can  we  guide  dual-use  technologies  like 
engineering SARS-CoV-2 to benefit human society.
