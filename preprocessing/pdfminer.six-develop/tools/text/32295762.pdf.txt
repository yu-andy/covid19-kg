A 28-year-old man with asthma presented to the emergency 

department on Mar. 16, 2020, with chest discomfort, non-
productive cough and dyspnea despite use of a salbutamol 
inhaler. He had no travel or contact history. He reported 3 to 5 days 
of antecedent fevers, myalgias and arthralgias, and use of acetamin-
ophen. Physical examination showed normal basilar breath sounds 
and scattered wheezes. His vital signs were stable (36.8°C,  periph-
eral oxygen saturation [SpO2] 100%, 85 beats/min and blood pres-
sure  130/79 mm Hg).  His  bloodwork  was  normal  except  for  his 
C-reactive  protein  (32  [normal  <  11]  mg/L)  and  lymphocytes 
(0.4 [normal 1.5–4] × 103 cells/µL). 

A  computed  tomography  (CT)  scan  of  the  patient’s  chest 
(Figure  1)  showed  the  typical  appearance  of  COVID-19 
pneumonia,  according  to  a  recent  Radiology  Society  of  North 
America  expert  consensus  statement  on  chest  CT  findings  of 
coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), including bilateral peripheral 
and  rounded  ground-glass  opacities  and  regions  of  peripheral 
consolidation.1  The  radiologic  differential  included  bilateral 
pneumonia caused by typical or atypical pathogens, drug toxicity 
and organizing pneumonia.

A subsequent nasopharyngeal swab, taken in the emergency 
department immediately after the CT scan, was positive for COVID-
19  by  reverse  transcription  polymerase  chain  reaction  (RT-PCR; 
Seegene Allplex 2019-nCoV Assay), detecting RNA-dependent RNA 
polymerase (RdRp), envelope and nucleocapsid genes. The patient 
was admitted to a general medical ward, received oseltamivir and 
made a full recovery without admission to an intensive care unit.

Routine screening or diagnosis with CT scanning for COVID-19 is 
not recommended owing to cost, resource constraints during a pan-
demic and risk of spreading infection.2 However, CT may be used to 
expedite care in symptomatic patients with a negative or pending 
swab, and in those with worsening respiratory status or developing 
complications such as empyema or acute respiratory distress syn-
drome. One recent study of 601 patients showed chest CT scanning 
to be 97% sensitive, but only 25% specific compared with RT-PCR 
testing,3 which is both sensitive and specific (95%–97%).4 Our Can-
adian case highlights CT imaging features of COVID-19 consistent 
with the international experience.5
