Hand washing and maintaining social distance are the main measures recommended by the World Health
Organization (WHO) to avoid contracting COVID-19. Unfortunately, these measured do not prevent infection by
inhalation of small droplets exhaled by an infected person that can travel distance of meters or tens of meters in
the air and carry their viral content. Science explains the mechanisms of such transport and there is evidence that
this is a significant route of infection in indoor environments. Despite this, no countries or authorities consider
airborne spread of COVID-19 in their regulations to prevent infections transmission indoors. It is therefore
extremely important, that the national authorities acknowledge the reality that the virus spreads through air,
and recommend that adequate control measures be implemented to prevent further spread of the SARS-CoV-2
virus, in particularly removal of the virus-laden droplets from indoor air by ventilation.

The entire world is anxiously watching as COVID-19, a disease
caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, spreads from country to country,
following modern travel routes. It was first reported to the WHO
Country Office in China on 31 December 2019 (https://www.who.int/
emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/events-as-they-
happen). After that, it inevitably crossed the country’s boundaries, and
has become a global pandemic (WHO 2020b).

It could be said that compared with previous global epidemics or
pandemics, humanity is much better equipped to control the new epi-
demic. The virus’s gene sequence was identified and made public and a
testing method was developed within two weeks after its existence was
announced (Zhu et al. 2020), launching the race to develop a protective
vaccine (Yan et al. 2020). In addition, testing methods measuring the
infection (using RT-PCR) and measuring the antibodies formed after
being infected (using immunoassays) (Elfaitouri et al. 2005; Souf 2016).
Real-time statistics on all aspects of the virus’s transmission are avail-
able online (Worldometers 2020). Countries have enacted emergency
response procedures, and travel bans have been put in place (Tian et al.
2020), and lockdown procedures which limit the movement of people
inside the administrative zones.

Unfortunately, the truth is that we have only a rudimentary
knowledge of several aspects of infection spread, including on one
critical aspect of the SARS-CoV-2 virus: how THIS virus transmits
(Bourouiba 2020; Brosseau 2020). In general it is considered that viral
respiratory infections spread by direct contact, such as touching an

infected person or the surfaces and fomites that the person has either
touched, or on which large virus-containing droplets expired by the
person have landed (Morawska 2006), and there the virus can remain
stable for days (van Doremalen et al. 2020). The droplets can also be
deposited directly on a person in close proximity to the infected person.
Therefore, frequent hand-washing and maintaining a distance of at least
one meter (arm’s length) are considered the main precautions against
contracting the infection (WHO 2020a). One transmission route that is
mentioned only in passing, or not at all, is the transport of virus-laden
particles in the air. Immediately after droplets are expired, the liquid
content starts to evaporate, and some droplets become so small that
transport by air current affects them more than gravitation. Such small
droplets are free to travel in the air and carry their viral content meters
and tens of meters from where they originated (e.g. Morawska et al.
2009), as graphically presented in Fig. 1.

Is it likely that the SARS-CoV-2 virus spreads by air? Its predecessor,
SARS-CoV-1, did spread in the air. This was reported in several studies
and retrospectively explained the pathway of transmission in Hong
Kong’s Prince of Wales Hospital (Li et al. 2005; Xiao et al. 2017; Yu
et al. 2005), as well as in health care facilities in Toronto, Canada
(Booth et al. 2005), and in aircraft (Olsen et al. 2003). These studies
concluded that airborne transmission was the main transmission route
in the indoor cases studied. Other examples of airborne transmission of
viral infections include the spread of Norwalk-like virus between school
children (Marks et al. 2003), and the transmission of influenza A/H5N1

virus between ferrets (Herfst et al. 2012). A World Health Organization
(WHO 2009) review of the evidence stated that viral infectious diseases
can be transmitted across distances relevant to indoor environments by
aerosols (e.g. airborne infections), and can result in large clusters of
infection in a short period. Considering the many similarities between
the two SARS viruses and the evidence on virus transport in general, it
is highly likely that the SARS-CoV-2 virus also spreads by air (Fineberg
2020). Experts in droplet dynamics and airflow in buildings agree on
this (Lewis 2020). Therefore, all possible precautions against airborne
transmission in indoor scenarios should be taken. Precautions include
increased ventilation rate, using natural ventilation, avoiding air re-
circulation, avoiding staying in another person’s direct air flow, and
minimizing the number of people sharing the same environment (Qian
et al. 2018). Of significance is maximizing natural ventilation in
buildings that are, or can be naturally ventilation and ensuring that the
ventilation rate is sufficiently high. These precautions focus on indoor
environment of public places, where the risk of infection is greatest, due
to the possible buildup of the airborne virus-carrying droplets, the virus
likely higher stability in indoor air, and a larger density of people.
Public places include in the first instance heath care facilities: while in
many hospitals care to provide adequate ventilation is a routine mea-
sure, this is not the case in all hospital; often not where new patients are
admitted; nursing homes, etc. Shops, offices, schools, restaurants, cruise
ships, and of course public transport, is where ventilation practices
should reviewed, and ventilation maximized. Also, personal protective
equipment (PPE), in particular masks and respirators should be re-
commended, to be used in public places where density of people is high
and ventilation potentially inadequate, as they can protect against in-
fection others (by infected individuals) and being infected (Huang et al.
2019; Leung et al. 2020).

Precautions can be taken only when the national bodies responsible
for the control of the outbreak acknowledge the significance of this
route of transmission and recommend appropriate actions. Currently,
this is not the case anywhere in the world. In China, where the outbreak
started, the body overseeing the prevention and control of the epidemic
(the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China) has
issued a series of prevention and control guidelines. As of 12 March
2020, the guidelines have been updated six times (http://www.nhc.
gov.cn/jkj/s3577/202003/4856d5b0458141fa9f376853224d41d7.
shtml), reflecting some change in the Commission’s perception of the
mechanisms of the viral infection spread: from no mention of airborne
transmission at all to an admission of the possibility of this route of
transmission. However, the guidelines stopped short of accepting that
this is in fact happening, and instead stated in the latest version (7
March 2020) that airborne transmission “has not been determined”. In
Italy, which has emerged as one of the main hot spots in the world, the

distance of 1 m between people is recommended in indoor “red zones”,
but there is no mention of longer distance transport (Gazzetta Ufficiale
2020). The list of examples could go on. The US Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC Page last reviewed: October 30, 2018)
takes a broader view of viral infection spread, stating that: “Airborne
transmission over longer distances, such as from one patient room to another
has not been documented and is thought not to occur”. At the time of
writing, the daily increase in the number of cases of COVID-19 in the
USA is fast (WHO et al., 2020).

It is difficult to explain why public health authorities marginalize
the significance of airborne transmission of influenza or coronaviruses,
but a possible reason is that it is difficult to directly detect the viruses
traveling in the air. Immediately after expiration, the plume carrying
the expired viral content is diluted, and as it travels in the air carried by
the air flow. In the process, the concentration of the virus does not
increase uniformly in the interior environment of the enclosed space,
but it is elevated only in the flow (if there is adequate ventilation, which
is normally the case in medical facilities or on aircraft) (Morawska
2006). Therefore, sampling for the presence of the virus requires
knowledge of the air flow from the infected person, and a sufficiently
long sampling period to collect enough copies of the viruses. Both these
requirements present major challenges: microbiologists collecting viral
samples are not normally experts in building flow dynamics, and
practicality prevents long sampling times that would be adequate for
the sensitivity of existing viral detection methods (Booth et al. 2005).
The fact that there are no simple methods for detecting the virus in
the air does not mean that the viruses do not travel in the air. The
above-mentioned retrospective modeling studies explained the trans-
mission of SARS-CoV-1 in 2003 (Booth et al. 2005; Li et al. 2005; Olsen
et al. 2003; Xiao et al. 2017; Yu et al. 2005). While we do not yet have
all the required data in hand, including for example data on the patterns
of infections, or specific indoor characteristics where the infections
occurred, analysis of the initial pattern of COVID-19 spread in China
reveals multiple cases of non-contact transmission, especially in areas
outside Wuhan, such as those in Hunan and Tianjin. On numerous
cruise ships where thousands of people onboard were infected, many of
the infections occurred after the imposition of isolation that confined
passengers for the majority of time to their cabins, and limited direct
contact, and with hand hygiene carefully obeyed. Was it therefore the
ventilation system that spread the airborne virus between the cabins
one of the reasons for the infections? There are also hypothesis, that
airborne transmission was at least partially responsible for a larger
number of infections during a choir, where 45 out of 60 choir members
were infected (Read 2020).

Despite the evidence and strong hypotheses, the world appears to be
locked in the old way of thinking that only direct contact matters in

viral infection spread. It is disconcerting that with all the experience
and evidence currently available, when faced with a new viral outbreak
of COVID-19, the authorities still fail to acknowledge the airborne
pathway of transmission, although many experts in China and other
countries have had experience in dealing with SARS.

We predict that this failure to immediately recognize and ac-
knowledge the importance of airborne transmission and to take ade-
quate actions against it will result in additional cases of infection in the
coming weeks and months, which would not occur if these actions were
taken. The air transmission issue should be taken seriously now, during
the course of the epidemic. When the epidemic is over and retrospective
data demonstrates the importance of airborne transmission it will be
too late. Further, the lessons learnt now will prepare us better for when
the next epidemic strikes.

To summarize, based on the trend in the increase of infections, and
understanding the basic science of viral infection spread, we strongly
believe that the virus is likely to be spreading through the air. If this is
the case, it will take at least several months for this to be confirmed by
science. This is valuable time lost that could be used to properly control
the epidemic by the measures outlined above and prevent more infec-
tions and loss of life. Therefore, we plead that the international and
national authorities acknowledge the reality that the virus spreads
through air, and recommend that adequate control measures, as dis-
cussed above be implemented to prevent further spread of the SARS-
CoV-2 virus.
