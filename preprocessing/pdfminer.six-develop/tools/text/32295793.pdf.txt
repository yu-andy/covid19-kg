To monitor the COVID-19 pandemic we 
need better quality primary care data

 UK primary care coding of covid-19 is a mess: we need to stop the use of bad codes, and migrate 
from the use of ugly to good codes, but will only be able to do so when they are finally released.
Key data computerised medical record (CMR) systems are recorded using ’codes’, to standardise 
recording and so attendances about a medical problem can be linked.1 At the start of the COVID-19 
pandemic there was neither international agreement about nomenclature nor codes available in 
primary care CMRs with which to record exposure, testing, or infection.

We have now been through three iterations of clinical codes in the UK since the end of January. 
Five  temporary  codes  were  added  to  all  the  primary  care  CMR  systems  using  the  ‘2019  nCoV 
(Wuhan)’ label in January 2020. Subsequently NHS Digital, the NHS coding organisation, released 
a more extensive set of SNOMED CT concepts named ‘2019 nCoV (novel coronavirus)’ because the 
use of ‘Wuhan’ had been deprecated; these codes were in turn replaced by ‘SARS –CoV-2 (severe 
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2)’ 2

The situation has been further complicated by the fact that this last release is only now starting 
to become available in CMRs (Table 1), and because some clinicians have gone back to using old 
non- specific coronavirus codes (such as ‘Suspected Coronavirus infection: 1JX’, and ‘Coronavirus 
infection: A795’).

This creates challenges for the surveillance system and others monitoring the pandemic.3 We have 
previously classified the incorrect use of codes as miscoding, misclassification, or misdiagnosis.4 In 
the cases of COVID-19, we are seeing1 both Miscoding (that is, continued use of the temporary 
codes,  which  should  stop  once  the  new  ones  are  available);2  and  Misclassification  (use  of  non- 
specific coronavirus codes), which should stop. Table 1 sets out the clinical concept we currently 
need to consistently record in primary care, the temporary codes available to do this, and the final 
codes  we  should  all  eventually  use.  Prompt  cards  to  help  clinicians  and  coders  are  available  at:

Competing interest: The authors 
declare that no competing 
interests exist.

All  UK  primary  care  clinicians  and  coders  are  recommended  to  continue  to  use  the  temporary 
codes  until  the  new  ones  are  available,  then  switch.  Accurate  data  is  a  key  to  understanding  and 
monitoring the course of this pandemic.

Appendix: Examples of codes not to use

•	 Exposure to coronavirus infection
•	 Suspected coronavirus infection
•	 Coronavirus infection
•	 Disease due to Coronaviridae
•	 Coronavirus contact
