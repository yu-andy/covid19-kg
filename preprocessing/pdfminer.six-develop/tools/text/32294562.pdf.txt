Abstract:  

Background:  The  COVID-19  has  now  been  declared  a  global  emergency  by  the  World  Health 

Organization. There is an emergent need to search for possible medications.  

Method:  Utilization  of  the  available  sequence  information,  homology  modeling,  and  in  slico 

docking a number of available medications might prove to be effective in inhibiting the COVID-

19 two main drug targets the spike glycoprotein and the 3CL protease.  

Results: Several compounds were determined from the in silico docking models that might prove 

to be effective inhibitor for the COVID-19. Several antiviral medications: Zanamivir, Indinavir, 

Saquinavir,  and  Remdesivir  show  potential  as  and  3CLPRO  main  proteinase  inhibitors  and  as  a 

treatment of COVID-19.  

Conclusion: Zanamivir, Indinavir, Saquinavir, and Remdesivir are among the exciting hits on the 

3CLPRO main proteinase. It is also exciting to uncover that Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide (FAD) 

Adeflavin, B2 Deficiency medicine, and Coenzyme A, a coenzyme, may also be potentially used 

for  the  treatment  of  SARS-CoV-2  infections.  The  use  of  these  off-label  medications  may  be 

beneficial in the treatment of the COVID-19. 

Keywords: SARS-CoV-2, Coronavirus, molecular docking, approved drugs, medications 

Introduction: 

The World Health Organization has now declared a global emergency and pandemic for 

the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) that has been actively spreading around the globe. COVID-

19  which  is  caused  by  the  virus  SARS-CoV-2;  can  cause  symptoms  such  as  fever,  cough, 

2 

pneumonia, nausea,  and  fatigue. As of now  SARS-CoV-2 has  reached 24 countries around the 

globe, with more than 190,000 cases confirmed as of March 18, 2020.(Organization, 2020)  

The epidemiological background of the virus was thought to stem from a seafood market 

in Wuhan, China.(Chen et al.) However, the true epicenter of the initial transfer to humans is still 

unknown. Currently, there are >100 complete genome sequences known in the NCBI GenBank, 

from over 10 countries. The variation between these sequences is less than 1%.  

This virus is closely  related to the SARS CoV  and this allows utilization of the  known 

protein structures to quickly build a model for drug discovery on this new SARS-CoV-2.(Hui et 

al., 2020) While traditional methods of drug discovery could take years, the approach taken here 

to  search  for  possible  medications  for  the  SARS-COV-2  is  in  silico  docking  models  from  the 

most variable proteins in the SARS-CoV-2, the spike  glycoprotein, and the  SARS-CoV-2 3CL 

main protease. 

The  CoV  spike  protein  binds  to  a  host  cells  membrane  through  a  receptor  mediated 

interaction which allows entrance to the host cell. It has been  computationally determined that 

the SARS-CoV-2 has similar mechanism to that of the SARS virus and the receptor to which it 

has the highest affinity is ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2).(Xu et al.)  While there are 

structural similarities between the SARS-CoV-2  spike protein  and the  SARS spike protein, the 

conservation is only 73% with most of the variability being in the host cell interaction region of 

the protein. Currently there is no crystal structure available for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, 

so  we  employed  homology  modeling  of  the  SARS-CoV-2  utilizing  the  SARS  spike  protein 

(PDB: 2GHV) as a template.  

The second in silico docking model is the 3CLPRO main protease, which is responsible for 

controlling several major functions of the virus and has a highly conserved catalytic domain from 

 

3 

the SARS virus.(Anand  et al., 2003) Some of its functions include the replication processes of 

the virus which makes it an ideal target for drug development.(Bacha et al., 2004) The SARS-

CoV-2 main protease was determined by Liu, X et. al (PDB: 6LU7).(Liu) 

Both these proteins, spike and protease, are essential to the transmission and virulence of 

the  virus.  By  inhibiting  anyone  of  these  two  proteins  or  both  for  a  higher  active  therapy,  the 

severity of the infection will be reduced. Our efforts have been placed in competitively inhibiting 

the  binding  of  its  natural  substrates.  A  library  of  known  bioactive  compounds  has  been  run 

against several sites on the spike protein and the catalytic site of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease. 

By  utilizing  an  approved  compound  database,  quick  trials  of  these  compounds,  with 

minimal effort of approval by food and drug agencies, could be carried out. We have chosen to 

run the Zinc15 database which is classified by Zinc15(Sterling and Irwin, 2015) as “Approved 

drugs in major jurisdictions, including the FDA, i.e DrugBank approved”. This database covers 

all major bioactive pharmaceutical compounds utilized around the globe, and currently has 3,447 

entries.  

Methods: 

Molecular Docking 

 

 

Molecular  docking  calculations  were  completed  using  Schrodinger®  docking  suits 

(Schrödinger  Maestro,  New  York,  NY,  USA.  Version  11.9.011,  MMshare  Version  4.5.011, 

Release  2019-1,  Platform  Windows-x64)  using  a  virtual  screening  workflow.  This  workflow 

utilized three docking precisions, HTVS, SP, and XP, which yielded the top 10% of hits for each 

binding site. Both proteins were prepared by restrained minimization using force field OPLS3e. 

The grid sites were created using Glide® receptor grid generator with docking length of 20 Å. 

4 

Grids  centers  were  determined  from  active  resides  on  target  protein.  Ligands  were  prepared 

using force field OPLS3e and possible states were generated from pH 7.0 +/- 2.0. Docking scores 

are reported kcal/mol, the more negative the number, the better binding.   

Homology Modeling of Spike Protein 

The  surface  glycoprotein  [Wuhan  seafood  market  pneumonia  virus]  (Sequence  ID: 

YP_009724390.1)  structure  was  modeled  using  ModBase(Pieper  et  al.,  2014)  which  utilized 

Modeller(Eswar  et  al.,  2008)  for  the  structural  modeling.  The  sequence  (NCBI  Accession: 

YP_009724390)  was  uploaded  to  the  ModBase  interface  and  was  run  with  the  template  being 

SARS spike protein receptor binding domain (PDB: 2GHV, Chain E). The sequence identity was 

found  to  be  73%  (Figure  1A).  The  calculation  was  completed  and  imported  into  Schrödinger 

Maestro®. The structure was then minimized using the force field OPLS3e the overlay of the pre 

and post minimized structure can be seen in Figure S2. 

Results: 

Spike Glycoprotein 

Sequencing has revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 is similar to that of the SARS-CoV virus 

which allows for genomic and proteomic homology comparison. Using the homology modeling 

we  have  been  able  to  develop  a  model  of  the  Spike  glycoprotein  (Figure  1).  This  model  has 

allowed us to perform docking calculations utilizing a database of known bioactive and approved 

compounds.

Green: SARS-CoV Red: SARS-CoV-2. B) Minimized final structure of modeled SARS-CoV-2 

spike glycoprotein.  

The  MODELLER  and  ModBase  programs  were  able  to  use  a  homologues  SARS  spike 

protein  (PDB:  2GHV)  and  the  original  SARS-CoV-2  sequence  (GenBank:  MN908947)  and 

construct  the  SARS-CoV-2  spike  protein.    Protein  was  then  run  through  a  restriction 

minimization  process  utilizing  Schrodinger  Docking  Suits®  Protein  Preparation  which  allows 

side chains to be placed in the most energetically favorable conformation (Figure 1B).  

In an effort to stop the Spike-ACE2 interaction, several sites have been determined and 

targeted  on  the  Spike  protein  for  docking  studies.  Three  of  these  sites  are  located  at  the 

interaction points specifically where hydrogen bonding is calculated as the main intermolecular 

force of the Spike-ACE2 interaction and a fourth allosteric site has been determined by surface 

mapping of the protein.  

6 

The locations of the binding sites have been chosen as these would cause the most destruction in 

ACE2 interactions. The sites are labeled as site 1-4 and information on the sties can be seen in 

Supplemental (Table S1, Figure S1). The results from the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein are 

reported in Table 1.

3CLPRO Main Protease 

Structural alignments have revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 protease is highly conserved 

for that of the SARS (PDB: 1LVO) main protease at 98% ID.(Anand et al., 2002) The  3CLPRO 

main protease was run through a restriction minimization process utilizing Schrodinger Docking 

Suits (figure S3A). Previous studies have revealed in the SARS protease mutation of the residue 

His162  renders  the  enzyme  inactive.  The  SARS-CoV-2  homologous  residue  is  His163  (Site  1 

center: x = -17.59, y = 15.81, z = 63.53) (figure S3B) which has been used as the central point 

for  molecular  docking  calculations.  The  active  site  also  revealed  a  second  Histidine  (center: 

His41 Site 2 center: x = -13.81, y = 19.72, z = 71.91) (figure S3C) that seems to play a role in the 

interactions of  the bound ligand in the 6LU7 structure, so this was targeted as a second  center 

 

7 

point  for  the  molecular  docking  calculations.  The  results  from  the  SARS-CoV-2  3CL  protease 

are reported in Table 2.

Conclusion: 

Molecular  docking  has  been  employed  for  the  search  of  possible  medications  that  fall 

under  the  approved  bioactive.  The  hit  compounds  reported  here  have  potential  to  inhibit  the 

SARS-CoV-2  spike  protein  and  the  3CLPRO  main  protease  but  are  not  guaranteed  to  have  any 

activity;  however,  this  lays  the  groundwork  for  computational  drug  discovery  for  new 

compounds to reduce transmission and symptoms of the SARS-CoV-2. We have used structural 

homology modeling to determine a dock-able target for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and have 

utilized the newly characterized 3CLPRO main protease in our docking models.

We have several exciting hits on the 3CLPRO main proteinase. Zanamivir is an approved 

medication  for  the  treatment  of  influenza  A  and  B  viruses.(Eiland  and  Eiland,  2007)  Indinavir 

and Saquinavir have been shown to treat and prevent HIV. Remdesivir is an antiviral compound 

in experimental stages that has shown  activity  against the SARS-coronavirus, Ebola virus, and 

possibly the SARS-CoV-2.(Sheahan et al., 2017; Tchesnokov et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020) It 

is  also  exciting  to  uncover  that  Flavin  Adenine  Dinucleotide  (FAD)  Adeflavin,  B2  Deficiency 

medicine,  and  Coenzyme  A,  a  coenzyme,  may  also  be  potentially  used  for  the  treatment  of 

SARS-CoV-2 infections.
