In early December 2019, a pneumonia of unknown origin
was first diagnosed in Wuhan, China (1). The pathogen was
identified as a novel coronavirus and was subsequently
named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) (2). On January 30th, 2020, The World Health
Organization (WHO) declared coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) a public health emergency of
international
concern (3). As of March 18th, 2020, there were 212,616
laboratory-confirmed cases worldwide (4). Governments
have responded in various ways to this evolving public
health emergency (3,5,6).

In light of the emerging data (1-3,6,7), we discuss issues to
be considered as health systems systematize their responses.
We are not trying to predict the future, but rather, present
potential scenarios. Herein, we provide the perspective of the
Instituto do Câncer do Estado de São Paulo (ICESP) - Hos-
pital das Clínicas da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade
de São Paulo, a publically funded tertiary referral cancer
center in Brazil. The current editorial does not represent
institutional or governmental positions. Formal policies
take time to receive official approval. Because of the urgent
need for local, regional, and national preparation, we write
collectively as free thinkers with the best interests of society
in mind, and as responsible doctors that have vowed to
provide the best care for our patients (8).

The Spanish Influenza pandemic of 1918-1919 has provided
us with uncontrolled populational data on the importance
of social measures for mitigating the harm of epidemics.
Historical work (9) and mathematical modelling studies (10)
suggest that early and sustained implementation of such

measures significantly reduced mortality rates during the
1918-1919 epidemic in the United States.

The SARS-CoV-1 2002-2003 epidemic has also taught us
valuable lessons. As stated in the WHO consensus report,
‘‘the experience in affected areas has shown that the trans-
mission can be prevented by adherence to basic public health
measures,
including rapid case detection, case isolation,
contact tracing and good infection control, including hand-
washing and the use of personal protective equipment’’ (11).
Prevention and case isolation are perhaps the most critical
steps to prevent any given epidemic, and require active
effort from authorities at all levels. These non-pharmacologic
interventions play an important role in mitigating a com-
munity-wide epidemic, by 1) delaying the exponential
growth of the curve, 2) reducing the number of cases, and
3) spreading the total demand over a longer period of time
to match the capacity of hospitals and other healthcare
settings (10).

Social institutions like churches have played an essential
role in shifting the general public mindset from debauchery
or indifference toward prevention. Practical measures have
been implemented, including the prohibition of kisses and
holding hands during mass (12,13) and avoiding common
vessels during eucharistic communion (14). Social greetings
like kisses and handshaking should be avoided in any
environment, especially in hospitals.

In a recent publication, the China Medical Treatment
Expert Group for COVID-19 reported on the epidemiology
and clinical outcomes of 1099 laboratory-confirmed COVID-
19 cases (1). Severe illness occurred in 15.7% of the patients
after admission to the hospital, 5.0% were admitted to the
ICU, 2.3% underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and
1.4% died. Severe disease was associated with comorbid
disorders and older age. Of note, in patients with comorbid-
ities, early estimates of the case-fatality rate were up to
73.3%, Data Supplement, Table S3 from Guan et al. (1). Only
0.9% of the cohort had cancer.

At this moment, it seems too early to tell if these estimates
are generalizable or even accurate, but caution is warranted
for patients with comorbid disorders.
If real mortality
parameters are within the range of published data, there is

a significant risk of severe events, and every effort should be
taken to guarantee that suspected cases receive an adequate
evaluation. Complexity is added to the triage by the fact that
only 43.8% had fever on hospital admission (1) and by
extensive differential diagnoses in cancer patients such as
febrile neutropenia, antitumor drug side effects, and other
infections.

Regarding cancer patients, follow-up consultations and
exams from patients with no active disease or treatment
could be postponed to reduce the risk of exposure. Patient
companions should consider going to the hospital only when
necessary. Attention should also be given to food-courts and
cafeterias, both within and nearby the hospital, given that
healthcare workers and patients may share the same zone
without proper protective equipment.

Before initiating systemic anticancer treatment, physicians
should weigh the evolving COVID-19 epidemic risk. Factors
like disease severity, the potential benefit from treatment,
drug schema immunosuppression potential, patient age, and
comorbid conditions should be considered. In the adjuvant
or neoadjuvant scenarios, physicians should consider the
pros and cons of every available treatment option. We should
also consider prophylactic interventions as soon as consistent
data demonstrate antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2 in
clinical trials, for either the patients, their households, or
health care personnel.

Surgery is central in cancer treatment. Should there be
an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in Brazil,
elective surgeries could be postponed. There are a limited
number of intensive care units (ICUs), with an imbalance
between the public and private sectors (15). Along with
Brazilian authorities’ efforts to improve the number of
ICU beds during the COVID-19 outbreak, logistics need to
be implemented to avoid contact between exposed and non-
exposed patients. Non-life-threatening surgeries could be
postponed until the epidemic is under control, both to avoid
the risk of intercurrent COVID-19 infection and to guarantee
ICU beds to critical patients. In cases with neoadjuvant
treatment, the interval to surgery needs to be entered into the
equation. It is estimated that 10% of patients affected by
COVID-19 need prolonged admission in ICUs. This empha-
sizes the importance of non-pharmacologic community strate-
gies to reduce incidence and lessen the need for healthcare
services (10).

that

In any given epidemic, real-time quality data is essential
for critical decision-making. The Brazilian Health Ministry is
to be commended for implementing a REDCap online form
for notification of suspected cases (16). Additional efforts are
needed in systems integration, so that relevant information
is available for healthcare workers and other stakeholders.
the Brazilian Health Ministry consider
We suggest
WHO recommendations (17) and lead the implementation
of standard online forms to collect sensitive data on clinical
characteristics, treatment, and outcomes.

laws to fight

Of note, Brazil’s legislative bodies are to be commended
for the fast approval of
the COVID-19
international public health emergency. The Federal Council
of Medicine (Conselho Federal de Medicina) and Ethics
Committees are to interpret the new law and clarify if
consent forms to diagnose and treat COVID-19 patients can
be waived (18). Should consent be needed, we suggest verbal
consent as a means to prevent pen and paper consent forms
from becoming a transmission route, as we have seen in the
Diamond Princess situation (19).

At this point, it is appropriate to comment on the fear that
excessive data may lead to panic among the general public.
We partially agree with this statement, though we also stress
that sensitive data need to be readily available to healthcare
providers and decision-makers in order to mitigate this
epidemic. Misinformation erodes public trust and may result
in backlash (20).

As the number of new cases accrue in Brazil, physicians
and healthcare workers on the front-line should have their
non-clinical workload reduced to a minimum, to focus on
adequate contact precautions and patient care. Healthcare
to
providers should reallocate administrative personnel
perform non-clinical tasks including paperwork-filling and
data collection as much as possible. Hospitals should take
their time to train staff to effectively implement contact
precautions and flow processes. Adequate emotional support
for staff and reasonable hours of risk exposure are also sug-
gested to prevent burnout, as health professionals struggle to
care for patients and protect their lives and families.

We hope this editorial may foster discussion among the
authorities and healthcare stakeholders, and help to plan and
implement pathways to minimize the impact of the COVID-
19 epidemic.
