The World Health Organization (WHO) has character-
ized the disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),
as a pandemic on March 11, 2020 (www.who.int). As of
March 11, the WHO had recorded a total of 118,326
confirmed COVID-19 cases, with 4292 death cases
cumulative mortality of
(www.who.int). While
COVID-19 is 3.63%, COVID-19 has resulted in more
death cases than SARS and MERS combined [1].
Within China, a total of 80,955 cases are confirmed,
with 4257 severe cases in mainland China (www.nhc.

Based on this, when COVD-19 patients develop ARDS
and mechanical ventilation cannot be improved, extra-
corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) can be used
[3]. As mortality rates among critically ill COVID-19 pa-
tients can be as high as 61.5% [4], ECMO may play a
role in reducing mortality rates [5]. The indications of
using ECMO are “For patients with severe ARDS, it is
recommended to perform lung expansion. In the case of
adequate human resources, prone positioning should be

Worldwide data on prognosis when using ECMO to
treat critically ill patients with COVID-19 infection
are not available, and whether ECMO plays a role in
reducing patient mortality rates is currently unknown.
This research letter provides the first evidence of
prognosis in treating critically ill COVID-19 patients
with ECMO in China. These preliminary data were
collected from two medical centers of Wuhan, China
(Table 1). These data could be of considerable value
in judging whether ECMO should be recommended
as a salvage therapy for critically ill COVID-19
patients.

To date, the role of ECMO in the management of
COVID-19 is unpromising. Nearly half of the patients
treated with ECMO died from septic shock and multiple
organ failure. The observed late complications included
bleeding and infection. While
the World Health
Organization (WHO) interim guidelines and China’s na-
tional interim guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment
of COVID-19 infection (sixth version) have made gen-
eral recommendations for the use of ECMO for ARDS
and critical COVID-19 infection [3, 5], the preliminary
evidence available in mainland China does not support
this general recommendation.

Certainly, understanding the risk-to-benefit ratio of
performing ECMO on critically ill COVID-19 patients is
dynamic as the course of this novel disease unfolds. The
Chinese government covers all costs to treat patients
with the COVID-19 infection, so the cost analysis of
to date unavailable in mainland China.

However, an average ECMO procedure in the USA costs
$73,122 USD,
indicating that ECMO is a highly
resource-demanding procedure [7]. Therefore, a further,
larger sample size study and a comprehensive analysis of
the medical value of using ECMO on COVID-19 pa-
tients are urgently required. Based on the two cohort
case series in this study, nearly half of the critically ill
COVID-19 patients with ECMO were dying from septic
shock and multiple organ failure. As anticipated by
MacLaren et al. [3], COVID-19 is a pandemic; all health-
care resources are stretched so that ECMO is not a ther-
apy to be rushed to the frontline. Therefore,
