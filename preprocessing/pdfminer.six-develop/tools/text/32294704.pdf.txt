By  the  end  of  2019,  a  novel  coronavirus  (severe  acute  respiratory  syndrome 
coronavirus  2  or  SARS-CoV-2)  was  identified  as  the  etiologic  agent  of  an 
outbreak  of  pneumonia  in  the  city  of  Wuhan,  province  of  Hubei,  in  China. 
The virus had a rapid dissemination, with person-to-person transmission and 
cases soon identified throughout the world. The disease was called COVID-19 
(coronavirus disease 2019), with several new outbreaks related to community 
transmission. It is now classified as pandemic.(1-4)

We have observed an increase in requests of chest computed tomography 
(CT)  since  the  first  records  of  cases  in  Brazil;  therefore,  in  a  near  future, 
the  current  installed  capacity  of  the  system  to  analyze  and  produce  the  CT 
reports may be exceeded. It is crucial to highlight that the definite diagnosis 
of COVID-19 is made by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and 
a normal (negative) chest CT does not rule out diagnosis. However, currently, 
the  RT-PCR  result  has  taken  longer  than  CT  reports  to  be  available,  so  CT 
has  taken  an  important  role  in  a  comprehensive  assessment  of  patients,  for 
demonstrating  high  sensitivity  (although  low  specificity),  to  detect  the  most 
frequent pulmonary findings of the disease.

In  this  high  demand  urgency  context  to  provide  results,  it  is  advisable 
that  the  content  of  the  radiological  report  be  very  objective  and  as  clear  as 
possible  for  the  requesting  physicians  from  the  emergency  department.  The 
most relevant pieces of information to be conveyed are presence (or not) of 
pulmonary involvement, if the findings are compatible with infectious process, 
and, in positive cases, if the changes are suggestive of viral etiology, particularly 
COVID-19,  even  if  there  is  overlapping  of  findings  with  other  infectious 
diseases (including other viruses). We also included an approximate estimate 
of  extent  of  pulmonary  involvement  by  the  disease  (visual  analysis),  which 
has been considered useful by them in management of patients, together with 
other clinical data and physical examination. In our Institution, involvement 
of >50% of parenchyma(5) has been used as an additional criterion to decide 
for hospitalization.

In a structured report, we initially describe if there are pulmonary changes 
or not, and if they are suggestive of a pulmonary infectious process. In case

with  the  more  typical  pattern  described  in  COVID-19: 
including  ground-glass  opacities,  sometimes  with 
superimposed  interlobular  septal  thickening  (crazy 
paving),  consolidations  and  reversed  halo,  presenting 
a  bilateral  multilobar  distribution,  predominantly 
peripheral,  with  mild  predilection  for  the  posterior 
regions  and  lower  lobes.(6-10)  In  these  cases,  we  have 
highlighted  in  our  reports  that  “the  possibility  of 
COVID-19  should  be  considered  in  the  differential 
diagnoses”,  and  also  included  the  estimated  extent  of 
parenchyma  involvement  (greater  or  lesser  than  50%).(5)  
Figure 1 shows a case with typical imaging findings of 
COVID-19 and the model of provided report.

In  patients  with 

findings  more 
suggestive  of  other  type  of  infection  which  obviously 

tomographic 

must  not  be  neglected  amidst  the  pandemic,  we  have 
described the changes and concluded as follows: “Such 
findings  are  compatible  with  pulmonary  infectious 
process, and its characteristics are not typically observed 
in  cases  of  pulmonary  involvement  by  COVID-19; 
other  etiologic  agents  should  be  initially  considered 
in  the  differential  diagnosis.”  As  examples  of  changes 
described  in  the  literature  as  uncommon  in  cases  of 
COVID-19, which increase the probability of infection 
by  other  agents,  we  underline  numerous  centrilobular 
micronodules  with  tree-in-bud  pattern,  relatively  well-
defined  solid  nodules,  cavities,  predominant  central 
parenchyma involvement, mainly affecting the airways.(6-9)  
Figure 2 displays an example of one of those cases and 
its respective report, with final diagnosis of tuberculosis 
after complete investigation.

evidence of pulmonary infectious process, we clearly and 
explicitly report the following phrase: “Absence of focal 
pulmonary  opacities  suggestive  of  active  parenchymal 
infectious process.”

Next,  other  additional  relevant  findings  are  briefly 
included,  emphasizing  the  presence  or  not  of  lymph 
node enlargement, pleural effusion, as well as pulmonary 
nodules, emphysema, chronic interstitial disease, aneurysms 
and marked atheromatous disease.

Developing structured reports in radiology, primarily 
those  oriented  to  certain  diseases,  provides  several 
benefits,  including  clarity  in  conveying  information  to 
requesting physicians and use of a common terminology, 
enabling all those involved to be familiar with specific 
terms used for each disease. Moreover, this later enables 
collecting  data  for  epidemiological  purposes,  quality 
control  and  research.(11,12)  Other  advantages  comprise 
increased radiologist productivy with less burden.(12)

Implementing  a  structured  report  should  be 
beneficial,  particularly  in  the  current  scenario  of 
COVID-19  pandemic,  for  increasing  productivity  of 
radiologists  and  enabling  better  understanding  of  the 
requesting physicians, with a potential positive impact 
in management of patients.(13)
